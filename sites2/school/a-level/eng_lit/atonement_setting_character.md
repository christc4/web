McEwan uses setting and characters in Atonement, to establish traditional ideas of villain and victim,
shape meaning into architectural descriptions and yet also provide valuable insight into characterization.
This essay will evaluate all three interpretations, in particular reference to the crime genre.
Upon first reading, McEwan shapes meaning into simple architectural descriptions throughout the first
five chapters. The family home of the Tallis’ is said to have been “[so] ugly, sunlight could not conceal
[this fact]. The superlative visual adjective is exposed by the sunlight, yet ugliness could refer to the
Tallis’ family inner nature itself, the house simply serving as representative for this notion. Moreover,
this view gains credence through the verb “conceals” which implies something is being hidden from
readers. Furthermore, although not necessarily an architectural description, a backstory is provided to
readers – their family fortune was made through “patents, padlocks, bolts, latches and hasps”. In some
ways this supplements the view that something “ugly” about the Tallis’ themselves is being concealed.
Moreover, a secondary reading can imply the very strength of the locks in question suggests something
is being sealed or something very important is being kept locked, which may potentially foreshadow
Robbie’s fate being sealed.
Another point to make is that McEwan establishes ideas of who is the villain and victim. Take for
instance, Robbie who is described as an “alien in a Northern climate”, the identifier “alien” evokes a
sense of insider vs outside, Robbie being “alien” immediately separates him from the upper-class
characters such as Paul Marshall and Briony. Yet, the tone of the word foreshadows how in this
“Northern climate” situations may not be geared to his favor, due to his status as an outsider.
Moreover, Robbie is affirmed as the typical victim, due to the prejudices set against him by Leon who
complains how “the cleaning lady’s son gets a scholarship, gets a scholarship... goes up”. The
prominence of his mother’s occupation in the sentence order, significantly implies this is how the upperclass view Robbie – in other words an inferior. The repeated emphasis on Robbie obtaining a
scholarship, essentially “going up [the class order” implies a tone of contention towards Robbie’s life
achievements. This not only places Robbie as the underdog, due to the disadvantages he faces, but
tones of malice can also be detected in Leon’s description, which could reflect how society will treat him
as a victim. Furthermore, McEwan establishes Paul Marshal as the archetypical villain of the novel, who
is described foremost as having a “cruel face”. The superlative visual aid creates a strong impression on
readers, as someone who is capable of inflicting pain or indifferent to suffering. We later learn that the
children had awoken Marshall, who was “uncomfortably aroused”. This fact alone, in relation to being
surrounded by children, evokes a strong sense of wariness in readers over his character.
Finally, McEwan uses characterization to provide an insight into the mental of characters such as Briony,
who is “possessed by a desire to have the world just so”, which suggests she has an idealistic view on
how the world should be set, perhaps shaped by those around her such as Leon. Moreover, we learn
that her “organized world denies her the reckless possibilities of wrongdoing” this creates a foreboding
tone, that something lurks beneath the surface, “mayhem and destruction were too chaotic for her
tastes”. A surface-level reading implies that Briony is physically incapable of inflicting harm onto others,
yet this can also be read to suggest she has a lot of pent-up energy. Moreover, Briony establishes a strict
dichotomy in the play, “The Trials of Arabella” of a wicked count and princess, which in some ways is
created in real life, with the fate of Robbie.
