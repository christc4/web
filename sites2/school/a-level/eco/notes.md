Explain why opportunity cost is a problem for governments of developing countries when servicing
detb?
Dept repayments, are an opportunity cost as any government spending towards paying debts is
spending that could have been directed towards reducing inequalities, I.e. alleviating poverty through
increased welfare schemes. Moreover, this may tackle other objectives such as reducing unemployment,
as inequalities such as education gaps are reduced through welfare schemes, more people can be
trained and enter the work force. However, to evaluate not paying the debt will severely damage a
country's credibility as a borrower, this may leave future governments unable to borrow and could
result in a series of regressive policies.
Discuss the benefits of remittances?
Remittances can be a significant proportion of GDP, 30% of Nepali GDP is comprised of international
remittances, this allows for more money into the circular flow of income, which is an injection and could
be used for infrastructure.
Moreover, this increases a countryâ€™s foreign currency reserves and may allow a developing country to
import more. However, uncertainty such as civil war in Afghanistan or Somalia may leave remittances an
unreliable source of income, for example in 2018 all remittances were blocked from Somalia, due to
international condemnation for their lack of government action.
Large foreign currency gap:
You cannot import, potential superior foreign goods, such as vaccines, which the home developing
country may lack R&D to develop, this may have adverse regressive affects. This may decrease HDI, as
