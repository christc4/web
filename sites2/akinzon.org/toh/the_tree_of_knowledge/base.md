TARGET DECK

BASE is an acronym of 3 (really 2) principles for NoSQL databases. 

**Basically Available** - The system should be available at all times, even if failures are occurring, even if some nodes have outdated data.

**Soft State** - The system should allow for eventual consistency, it does not need to be immediately consistent always.

**Eventual Consistency** - This is the idea that the system can be temporarily inconsistent, but will always converge into a consistent state.
