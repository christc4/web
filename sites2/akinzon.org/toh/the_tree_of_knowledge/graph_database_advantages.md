The flexible schema allows for nodes and edges to be added dynamically, which makes adapting to new data requirements much easier.

The graph data model also allows for nodes and edges to have properties associated with them (depending on the implementation of nodes and edges) which allows for [Metadata|metadata](metadata|metadata).

Graph Databases do not use [Adjacency Lists](adjacency_lists) or [Adjacency Matrices](adjacency_matrices) to store the graph, rather each node points to other nodes that it is related to. This gets rid of the cost of index lookups and allows for relationships to be traversed quickly.

Queries in Graph Databases are also very efficient, and so is graph traversal.
