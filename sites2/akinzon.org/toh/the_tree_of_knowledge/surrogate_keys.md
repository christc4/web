TARGET DECK

Surrogate keys are **system-maintained** keys that it uses to uniquely identify table entries.

Surrogate keys **do not represent real-world data**, and have no real meaning. do you have an ID number? (that isn't an NHS number or something similar)

They are only to be used as a last-resort where natural keys are not effective or efficient.

They are purely **implementation-specific** and have no place in a [logical modelling](logical_modelling) of a system - they break relational [Database Systems|database](database_systems|database) design!
