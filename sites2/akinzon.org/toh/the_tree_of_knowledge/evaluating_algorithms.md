**There are two key questions to ask in order to evaluate an algorithm:**

**Is it correct?**
	- Does it terminate?
	- Does it give the correct output for each possible input?

**Is it efficient?**
	- [Running Time of an Algorithm](running_time_of_an_algorithm)
	- [Space Complexity of an Algorithm](space_complexity_of_an_algorithm)
	- How many times does it access [External Memory|secondary storage](external_memory|secondary_storage)?


Algorithms we come up with are generally correct, so the **efficiency** of an algorithm is our chief concern: There's no point running an algorithm that takes until the end of time to complete!!!
