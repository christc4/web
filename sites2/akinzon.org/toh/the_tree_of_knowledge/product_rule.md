The product rule is a direct application of the Cartesian Product.

For two sets $A$ and $B$: $$ A \times B $$
Is the cartesian product. $$ |A| \times |B| = |A \times B| $$
It functions as a shortcut for enumeration

> [!TIP]- How many length-4 strings over the alphabet   $\{0, 1, ..., 9\}$ do not have repeated digits? 
> $|A_1 × A_2 × A_3 × A_4| = 10 · 9 · 8 · 7$

Given 3 sets $B, L, D:$ $$B = \{pancakes, bacon\ and\ eggs, bagel\}$$ $$L = \{burger\ and\ fries, salad, macaroni, pizza\} $$$$ D = \{steak, pasta\} $$

The set of all food options would be $$ B \times L \times D $$
