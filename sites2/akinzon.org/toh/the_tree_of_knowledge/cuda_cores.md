CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) cores contain a floating point unit and sometimes an integer unit (sounds very [Superscalar architecture|superscalar](superscalar_architecture|superscalar))

Also contain Special Function Units (SFUs) for trigonometric operations (Akash, 2017: "When are we gonna do Trig?")

CUDA cores are included within "streaming multiprocessors"
(About 128 of them, 16x more than in 2010!)

CUDA is programmed in **CUDA C**.
