TARGET DECK


One thing we know about sets is that order does not matter, and so we can order them in a way that makes searching more efficient.

It would be nice to make this binary search tree part of the `Collections` framework

This requires us to implement:
	 - `size()`
	 - `add()`
	 - `contains()`
	 - `remove()`
	 - `iterator()`
