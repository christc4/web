PCIe (Peripheral Component Interconnect express) is a serial bus that makes use of multiple lanes, each one being 1+ GiB/s

PCIe v3 - 1GiB/s
PCIe v4 - 2GiB/s
PCIe v5 - 4GiB/s

It is a form of [Point-to-point Interconnect](point-to-point_interconnect)ion

PCIe can also be used as an interface to [NVMe](nvme) for fast read/write speeds!
