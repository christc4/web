For a [Superclasses|superclass](superclasses|superclass) `Fighter`, and [Subclasses|subclass](subclasses|subclass) `Knight`:

```java
public class Fighter {
	private String name;
}

public class Knight extends Fighter { // tells us that the Knight is a Fighter and extends it
	super(); // though not necessary if thereis nothing to instantiate in the parent class, this is demonstrate that the super call should ALWAYS be the first thing called.
	private Sword sword;
}

```
