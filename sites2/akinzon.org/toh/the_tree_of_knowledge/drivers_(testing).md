TARGET DECK

Drivers are the "[The Main Method|main](the_main_method|main) programs" that accept data and pass the data on to the component that will be tested, and prints the results.

The initiate and oversee the execution of a component that is under test. They allow us to verify the functionality of the isolated component under test without having to test it in it's intended environment.

Similar to [Stub Objects|stubs](stub_objects|stubs), drivers are also used to fulfil the requirements of missing/incomplete components and modules.
