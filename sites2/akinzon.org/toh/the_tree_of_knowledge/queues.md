The queue is a FIFO (First In, First Out) [Abstract Data Types|abstract data type](abstract_data_types|abstract_data_type).

Its relevant methods are: `enqueue()`, for adding items to the queue (they go to the back, FIFO yo), `dequeue()`, for removing items from the front. `peek()` also returns, for checking what's at the front of the queue, and `isEmpty()` helps us check for an empty queue.

What are [queues](queues)? #flashcard 
Queues are FIFO abstract data types that hold an ordered linear sequence of items.
Queue methods: `enqueue()` add to back of queue, `dequeue()` to remove from the front of queue.
