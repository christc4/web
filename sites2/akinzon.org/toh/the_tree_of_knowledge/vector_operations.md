**Scalar multiplication** - Multiplying all component of a vector by a scalar value
	2(2, 5) becomes (4, 10)

**Vector Addition** - Adding the corresponding components of two vectors together
	(2, 5) + (1, 1) = (3, 6)
	Geometrically, this is done by joining the tip of one vector arrow to the tail of another

**Dot Product**
$$ x ∘ y=⟨ x , y ⟩=x_1 y_1+x_2 y_2+...+x _d y_ d=x^T y=|x||y|*cos(x , y ) $$ 
(Multiply all corresponding components and add the result)

**Magnitude of a Vector** - Pythagoras using all the components of a vector
