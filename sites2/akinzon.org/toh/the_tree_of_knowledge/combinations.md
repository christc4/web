Combinations are [Permutations](permutations) in which the order does not matter.

For combinations where repetition does not matter also, n-choose-k is used. 

Where repetition is allowed, you 'extend' the set of values from which you can make a choice by the number you need to choose then subtract one. It's more like $(n+k-1)$ choose $k$.

The funny example: Mike Tyson, Joe Biden, Elon Musk: As a combination, there is no order to them. However, such a combination can be permuted in different ways.

Combinations are different from each other if they have different [Sets|elements](sets|elements)

**n-choose-k:**

n-choose-k can be used to find the binomial coefficient.
