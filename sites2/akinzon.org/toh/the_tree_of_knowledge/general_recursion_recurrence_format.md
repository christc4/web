The typical format for recursion recurrences is as follows:
$$ T(n) \le a \cdot T(\frac{n}{b}) + o(n^d) $$
Where:
	- $a$ is the number of recursive calls
	- $b$ is the factor the input size is reduced by per call
	- $d$ is the exponent of the [Running Time of an Algorithm|running time](running_time_of_an_algorithm|running_time) in the "combine" step
