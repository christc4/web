# Independent Random Variables

TARGET DECK

Two variables $X$ and $Y$ are independent if for all $x ∈ \mathcal{X}, y ∈ \mathcal{Y}$:
$$ \mathbb{P}(X = x , Y = y) = \mathbb{P}(X = x)\mathbb{P}(Y = y) $$
Also, if two variables are independent, this would mean that the [marginal probability](marginal_probability) of one is the same as its [conditional probability](conditional_probability), as whether or not the 2nd variable occurs has no effect on the 1st.
