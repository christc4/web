# JavaFX Scene Graph

Up: [JavaFX Scenes](javafx_scenes)
Brother(s):
TARGET DECK

A scene's contents is defined by its scene graph.

Scene graphs start with the [JavaFX Stages|stage](javafx_stages|stage) and then the scene itself, and then the **root node.**

Each scene can only have one root [JavaFX Nodes|node](javafx_nodes|node).

These root nodes can have many children!

It works out very similarly to the [Composite Design Pattern](composite_design_pattern).
