The method 

```java
int compareTo(String str)
```

can be used to compare strings for *lexicographic order*, meaning if one string is greater than/lesser than another.

This method returns 0 if they are the same string, some negative number if string A is less than string B, and some positive number if string A is greater than string A.

This ordering is based on the [Unicode](unicode) representation of each character in the string.
