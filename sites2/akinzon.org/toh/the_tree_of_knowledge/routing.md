Routing occurs when there is a change in IP address spaces

This all takes place at the [TCP IP model|internet layer](tcp_ip_model|internet_layer) 

To facilitate this, routers have IP addresses for each address space they route in

This is done by a **router** - which can also act as a firewall

There can sometimes be multiple routes between hosts, which can sometimes aid performance if one route is busy

What is routing, and when does it occur? #flashcard 
Routing is when packets are sent between hosts (routers), and occurs when there is a change in IP address space.
