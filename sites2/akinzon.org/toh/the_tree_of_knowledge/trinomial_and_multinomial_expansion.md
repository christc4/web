For trinomial expansion and beyond, you cast the multinomial as a binomial to make use of the binomial expansion formula. Above, (y+z)^n-k gets its own binomial expansion while the bigger expression is being expanded. You can then combine the binomial coefficients and eliminate like terms to end up with a simpler expression. In trinomial, the n-k-j can be renamed to i, where n = i+j+k.
