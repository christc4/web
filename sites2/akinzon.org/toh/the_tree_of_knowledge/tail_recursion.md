[Methods](methods) where the recursive call is at the end of the method are known as **tail recursive.**

```java
Type foo(Types args) {
	...code...;
	return foo(args);
}
```

What would be an awesome thing to have for [Tail Recursion|tail recursive](tail_recursion|tail_recursive) [methods](methods) in Java? #flashcard 
It would be awesome if the same stack frame was used for the next method call, but it isn't.
