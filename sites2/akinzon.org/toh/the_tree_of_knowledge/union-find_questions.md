What are the two [Improvements to Quick-Union](improvements_to_quick-union)? #flashcard 
[Weighted Quick-Union](weighted_quick-union): Each [Trees|tree](trees|tree) has a weight which represents the number of nodes in the set, the smaller weight tree is added to the larger weight tree.
[Path Compression](path_compression): Since it can take a path of nodes from a value to its root, we also compute the root for more than one value when running `root(n)`. All these values become direct descendants of the root, flattening the tree.
