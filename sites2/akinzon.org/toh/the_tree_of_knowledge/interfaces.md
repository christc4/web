To first understand interfaces, you have to understand the [Limitations of OOP Without Interfaces](limitations_of_oop_without_interfaces) and [The Problem of Multiple Inheritance](the_problem_of_multiple_inheritance)

Interfaces solve both problems above

Interfaces are like 100% [Abstract Classes](abstract_classes), and have 0 implementation.

Instead, classes that implement an interface are contractually bound to provide implementations for each method in that interface!

[Implementation vs. Extension](implementation_vs._extension)

In a class signature, extension must come before implementation.
