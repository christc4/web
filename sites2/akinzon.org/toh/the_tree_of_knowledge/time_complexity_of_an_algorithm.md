Programmers plan with the worst case in mind, and so the **Time Complexity** of an algorithm is a [Functions|function](functions|function) of the input size $n$:
### $$ T: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}  $$
And $T(n)$ is the maximum number of primitive operations used by the algorithm on an input of size $n$. Replace maximum with minimum and you get the best-case running time, replace with average and you get the average-case running time.

For the worst case, the [Running Time of an Algorithm|running time](running_time_of_an_algorithm|running_time) can never be worse than $T(n)$, and for the best case the running time can never be faster than $T(n)$.

The average case running time is slightly better than the worst case, but is still proportional to $n$.
