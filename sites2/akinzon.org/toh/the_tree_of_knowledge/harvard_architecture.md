In the Harvard architecture, the data stores for data and instructions are kept separate, which means that they can be fetched in parallel, and can even have variable sizes for each data store! But, it does mean that more buses are required since there are more data stores to fetch from.

What is the Harvard architecture, its advantages and disadvantages? #flashcard 
The [Harvard Architecture](harvard_architecture) is a [The Processor|CPU](the_processor|cpu) architecture that keeps the instruction and data memory stores separate.
A benefit of this is that instructions and data can be fetched at the same time, but it means more buses are needed since there are 2 data stores, not just 1.
