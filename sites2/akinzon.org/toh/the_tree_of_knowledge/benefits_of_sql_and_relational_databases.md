SQL Relational Databases have a bunch of benefits:
	- **Simple model:** compared to other models, the relational database model is much simpler, and only needs simple queries
	- **Ease of use:** Users can easily access data fast
	- **Accuracy:** The [relational data model](relational_data_model) makes the database much more organised and reduces the risk of duplicate data
	- **Data Integrity:** The relational data model also gives the database much more consistency
	- **[Database Normalisation|Normalisation](database_normalisation|normalisation):** Normalising tables puts the table into a more organised structure, increasing data integrity and accuracy.
	- **Collaboration:** Multiple users can access the database simultaneously (concurrency)
	- **Security:** Relational Databases support access rights management and therefore ensures a level of security.
