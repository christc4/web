TARGET DECK

Big-theta allows us to compare algorithms by comparing their rates of growth, $\Theta (n^2)$ algorithms are always better than $\Theta (n^3)$ algorithms for a big enough $n$.

By measuring the running time on a small input, we can create estimates for larger inputs by deriving the constant.

> [!tip]- If $T(n) \approx cn^2$ for $n >> 1$, and for $c > 0$, and it took $x$ seconds on average for an input of size 100, how long would it take for an input of size $n$? Give your answer in terms of $x$ and $n$.
