# Memory to memory architecture

TARGET DECK

This (not used today) architecture would add A and B directly from memory (direct memory access is cool I guess) and store X in memory too.

However, it's ass cheeks because of its large variation in instruction size (don't get this in the others since registers are of a fixed size), and so you get a large variation in execution time for each instruction. Furthermore, accessing memory is much, much slower than accessing registers and so memory access bottlenecks the whole damn system. OOF.
