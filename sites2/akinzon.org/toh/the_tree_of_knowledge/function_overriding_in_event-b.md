Function overriding allows you to replace old mappings with new ones.

It is denoted by $f \triangleleft - g$. (but the line overlaps the triangle!!!)

for $f \triangleleft - g$, it is like removing the mappings for all the values in $g$'s domain that are in $f$ already, and replacing them with $g$'s mappings.
