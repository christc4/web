TARGET DECK

**Set of cultural norms/approaches for minimalistic, modular software development.**
1) Make each program do one thing well. New jobs will require new programs, instead of complex programs with multiple 'features'. So prevent them from being too bloated.
2) Expect the output of each program to be the input for another, so keep output as relevant and focused as possible.
3) Design software to fail fast, so that any imperfections can be found out sooner rather than later
4) Build tools in preference to lesser skilled ways of completing a task, even if its the longer route.
5) Programs should be able to handle text streams, since all programs can read/write text (universal interface).
