Memory Allocation in C is done using `malloc();`.

`malloc();` takes one argument, which is the size of memory to allocate.

How can we explicitly determine how many bits to allocate? [Checking The Size of Variables in C|size-of()!](checking_the_size_of_variables_in_c|size-of()!)

`sizeof()` to get the size of one unit, and multiply to get multiple of these blocks.
