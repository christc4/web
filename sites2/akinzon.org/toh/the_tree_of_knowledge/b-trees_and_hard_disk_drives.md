B-Trees can be used to store data efficiently on hard disks.

This is heavily preferred to [binary trees](binary_trees) because in binary trees in the worst case it would take $O(log(n))$ to find data, which actually gets really bad for large enough disks.

[Multiway Trees](multiway_trees) are used to get around this.
