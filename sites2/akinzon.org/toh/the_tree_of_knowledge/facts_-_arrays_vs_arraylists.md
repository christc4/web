| Arrays | ArrayLists |
| ---- | ---- |
| Cannot change size | Changes size as you add elements |
| Annoying to add new elements if you don't know if there is any free space | `ArrayLists` can handle their size themselves, just use the `add()` method |
| Must use array indices | Use of array indices are optional |
| `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` | `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` as well jajaja |

When removing an item from an ArrayList, all the items after it move up to fill in the gap.

Why might someone prefer [ArrayLists](arraylists) to [Arrays](arrays)? #flashcard 
ArrayLists may be better in cases where elements are constantly being added to it as they change size as elements are added.
