This problem is about encoding a message $M$ consisting of symbols from an alphabet $S = \{s_1,...,s_k\}$ 

It would be wasteful to use fixed-length encoding for small alphabets where the number of bits used to represent symbols of the alphabet can represent much more symbols than the alphabet contains.

The most efficient way is to use a variable length encoding, only using as many bits as you need.
