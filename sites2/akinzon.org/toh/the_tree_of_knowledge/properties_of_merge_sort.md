Merge sort is [Stability of an Algorithm|stable](stability_of_an_algorithm|stable), so long as merging is done carefully!

Merge sort is not [When an Algorithm is In-place|in-place](when_an_algorithm_is_in-place|in-place)..

Merging subarrays is quick, and can even be made quicker using [insertion sort](insertion_sort), which is faster on smaller arrays!

Merge sort is *asymptotically optimal*.
