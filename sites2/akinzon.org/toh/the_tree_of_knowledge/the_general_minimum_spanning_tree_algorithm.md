This is the general idea for obtaining a Minimum Spanning Tree:
	- Maintain a set of edges, $A$.
	- Before every iteration ([Loop Invariants|loop invariant?](loop_invariants|loop_invariant?)) $A$ is a subset of some Minimum Spanning Tree.
	- At each step we can add an edge to $A$ such that it is still a MST.
	- Such an edge is called **safe** for A (as if any edge that violated it was contaminated and unsafe!!)
