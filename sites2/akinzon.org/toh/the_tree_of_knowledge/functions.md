Functions simply map one [Sets|set](sets|set) to another set.

Functions take an input ([Functions with Multiple Inputs|or a set of inputs](functions_with_multiple_inputs|or_a_set_of_inputs)) and produce an output.

The set of all inputs to a function is called the **domain.**

The set that is mapped to is called the **codomain.**

The **largest** subset of the codomain that all inputs in the domain map to is called the **range.** This is also known as the image.

^ Only the elements in the codomain that have arrows on them are part of the range.

Functions are typically denoted by f, g, h (alphabet eh)

f: X → Y (Function f maps elements of X to Y)
X is the domain, Y is the codomain.

f(x) = y means that the value of f at x is y.

#### Equivalence of Functions
Functions f : X→Y and g : X→Y are only equal when they map the same elements of X to the same elements of Y (same behaviour)
In such a case:
	∀x ∈ X, f(x)=g(x)

#### Function Identities
For any set X, there is an identity function that maps set X to itself (but not necessarily that each element is mapped to itself)

It is denoted by $id_X$.
