SCSI (Small Computer System Interface) was a common standard for connecting peripherals to small computers, however, [USB](usb) is favoured above it. SCSI used parallel data transmission. 

SAS (Serial attached SCSI) is a serial version of SCSI, with its main usage being in servers. It's still commonly used.

SAS-3 has a bandwidth of 12 Gbps and SAS-4 has a bandwidth of 22-24 Gbps.
