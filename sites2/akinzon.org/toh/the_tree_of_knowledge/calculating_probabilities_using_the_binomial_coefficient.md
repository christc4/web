General formula:
$$ \frac{\binom{t}{n}}{2^{t}} $$
Where $t$ is the total number of tries, $n$ is the outcome whose probability we are looking for, $\binom{t}{n}$ being how many ways we can get the outcome in the total number of tries and $2^t$ being the total number of outcomes.

> [!TIP]- Suppose you flip a fair coin 5 times. What is the probability of getting 3 heads?
> ways to get 3 heads = $\binom{5}{3} = 10$
> $|â„¦| = 2^5 = 32$
> $\mathbb{P}(toss\ 5\ get\ 3\ heads) =  \frac{\binom{5}{3}}{2^{5}}=\frac{10}{32}$
