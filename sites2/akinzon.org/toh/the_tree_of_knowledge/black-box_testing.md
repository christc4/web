TARGET DECK

Black-box testing is a form of software testing where the tester has no knowledge of the underlying system.

Its emphasis is on the program's input/output behaviours: When you do `x`, does `y` happen as planned?

As mentioned, the tester does not need **any** knowledge of the underlying system, or programming at all!

Therefore, it can be performed by the end-user, developer, and any dedicated testers.
