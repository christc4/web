**Supercomputers** have the best contemporary computing power

It's common for them to have vector instructions or [Single Input, Multiple Data|SIMD](single_input,_multiple_data|simd)

They need a **HIGH** amount of power, like a power station's worth

They also need really good cooling systems (with all that [The Processor|processing](the_processor|processing), they're bound to get hot!)

^ Here is frontier, one of the greatest supercomputer currently. 1.1 Exaflops (floating-point operations per second), absolutely insane!!!
