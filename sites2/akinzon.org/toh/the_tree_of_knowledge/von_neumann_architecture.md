In Von Neumann's Architecture, both instructions and data have a common memory store. A benefit of this is that it is less complex than its alternative, but it means that you can only fetch one of either at a time.

What is the von Neumann architecture, its advantages and disadvantages #flashcard 
The [von Neumann Architecture](von_neumann_architecture) is a [The Processor|CPU](the_processor|cpu) architecture where instructions and data share their data store. A benefit is that it is less complex to implement, but instructions and data cannot be fetched simultaneously.
