TARGET DECK

Using exceptions instead of any other means of error handling allows for:
	 - cleaner code as normal code doesn't need to worry about error cases
	 - exceptions are universal and more understandable than your spur-of-the-moment error codes
	 - thrown exceptions don't need to be the same type as the [Methods|method's](methods|method's) return type.
	 - can use keyword `throws` to specify that a method throws an exception.
	 - exceptions are versatile - methods can throw more than one kind of exception!
