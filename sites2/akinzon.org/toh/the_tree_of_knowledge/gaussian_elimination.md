[Row Operations](row_operations)

These row operations can be used to [Inverse Matrices|invert matrices](inverse_matrices|invert_matrices)

These operations can also transform the system into a much more convenient form:
	Upper/lower triangular, where the rows either ascend/descend in the number of non-zero terms.

**[Matrices](matrices) can be used to represent linear systems of equations**

#### Row Echelon Forms

**Row echelon form** - A matrix is in row echelon form when each leading non-zero entry in a row (AKA pivot) is to the right of the pivot in the row above

All trailing entries can be any number, including zero

**Reduced row echelon form** - The pivot (defined above) is the only non-zero entry in its row.

****

**Row equivalency** - Two matrices are **row equivalent** if they can be transformed into each other using row operations.

Row-equivalent matrices have the same solutions.

Contradictory rows mean that there is no solution.
