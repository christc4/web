What is the useful degree property for directed and undirected graphs? #flashcard 
For a directed graph: Indegree = outdegree = all adjacencies = $|E|$
For an undirected graph: degree = all adjacencies = $2|E|$

When are adjacency lists preferred to adjacency matrices and vice versa? #flashcard 
Adjacency list are generally preferred for their $O(|E| + |V|)$ space complexity, which also takes up less space for sparse graphs compared to adjacency matrices with a space complexity of $O(|V|^2)$.
Adjacency matrices are preferred for more dense graphs, and are much faster for checking adjacency.
