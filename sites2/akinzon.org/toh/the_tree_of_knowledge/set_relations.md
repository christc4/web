#### Subsets & Proper Subsets
A set x is a **subset** of another set y if every element in x is also a member of y.

This is denoted by:
	X⊆Y

Every set is a subset of itself, and the empty set is also a subset of every set.

**Proper Subsets** are special subsets where not every member of set Y is in the subset X (**∃**y, y ∈ Y and y ∉ X.)

#### Equality of Sets
To show that two sets are equal, two things must be shown:
 - X⊆Y
 - Y⊆X
