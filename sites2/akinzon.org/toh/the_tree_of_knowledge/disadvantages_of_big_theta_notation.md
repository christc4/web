Algorithms with the same rate of growth are basically the same in big theta notation, and cannot be compared!

Big theta doesn't tell you much for small inputs, for an algorithm A that takes $n^3 + 2n^2 + 5$ operations to complete and an algorithm B that takes $20n^2 + 100$, for any input size $\lt 18$, algorithm A is actually faster! [Asymptotic Behaviour of the Running Time|Asymptotically](asymptotic_behaviour_of_the_running_time|asymptotically), B will be faster however.
