Class modelling is a type of modelling concerned with a system's structure, and how a system will meet its requirements.

From programming, we know that [classes](classes) describe some type of entity and its characteristics. These include:
	- structural features: What [objects](objects) of a class know ([Member vs Local Variables|member variables](member_vs_local_variables|member_variables))
	- behavioural features: What objects of this class can do ([Methods](methods))
