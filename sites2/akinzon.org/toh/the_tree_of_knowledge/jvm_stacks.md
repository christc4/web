The JVM applies [stacks](stacks) to store state information about what a thread is executing.

When a thread calls a method, a new [The Java Stack Frame|stack frame](the_java_stack_frame|stack_frame) is pushed onto the stack.

Even if a method calls a method and so on, this structure is preserved and we can go back to the first method since the return addresses are stored - see [Recursion](recursion)
