# Inclusion-Exclusion Principle (Probability Version)

TARGET DECK

For [Mutual Exclusivity|mutually exclusive](mutual_exclusivity|mutually_exclusive) events $A$ and $B$:
$$ \mathbb{P}(A \cup B) = \mathbb{P}(A) + \mathbb{P}(B)$$
Since the value of $\mathbb{P}(A \cap B) = 0.$

As a result, for non-mutual exclusive events $A$ and $B$:
$$  \mathbb{P}(A \cup B) = \mathbb{P}(A) + \mathbb{P}(B) - \mathbb{P}(A \cap B)$$


> [!TIP]- $â„¦ = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$ $E_1 = \{1\},\ E_2 = \{2, 3\},\ E_3 = \{3, 4\},\ E_4 = \{4,5,6\},\ E_5 = \{6\}$

> [!TIP]- find $P(E_2 \cup E_3 \cup E_4 \cup E_5)$ without using complement
> JUST DO IT.
