TARGET DECK

Selection Sort is [When an Algorithm is In-place|in-place](when_an_algorithm_is_in-place|in-place) (noice)

Selection sort is not [Stability of an Algorithm|stable](stability_of_an_algorithm|stable)â€¦


Selection sort always requires $(n-1) + (n-2) + ... + 2 + 1$ comparisons, and so it is $\Theta(n^2)$.

It is not as good as [Insertion Sort](insertion_sort)!!!
