The Simplex Method is an [Iteration|iterative](iteration|iterative) algorithm for solving [linear programming problems](linear_programming_problems). 

Each iteration of the simplex method gives a new basic feasible solution.

We do this in a very intuitive way: **increasing a variable $x_e$ that has a positive coefficient in [the objective function](the_objective_function) and increasing it as much as we can without violating the constraints.**  

The iteration is done by replacing [non-basic variables](non-basic_variables) with [basic variables](basic_variables).

The iteration stops when all coefficients in the objective function are minimised.
