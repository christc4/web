# Your Captain Speaking

Listen on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/mttTmwnqGNY?si=Inw3HY-Q5-o6Ga9M)

Hello folks good morning,
This is your captain speaking
We've got a fuel tank warning,
It's pretty badly leaking
Right out the guts of this metal bird,
Into the blue pacific,
We might have 15 minutes left,
If I were to be specific,
It'd bring a tear to a tatar's eye, 
Teach the weeping willow how to cry,
The golden years of your life go by,
Oh me oh my,
Right out  of the clear blue sky
Hello folks its me again,
Wishing I had some good news
But that's just life some days you win,
And other days you lose,
The ocean glitters in the sun,
It's been an honor to serve you,
God's children each and every one,
I surely don't deserve you,
You know you really couldn't pick,
A nicer day to die,
And I hope you choose pacific air,
The next time you fly,
It'd bring a tear to a tater's eye,
And teach the weeping willow how to cry,
The golden years of your life go by,
Oh me oh my,
Right out of the clear blue sky.


This sounds to me like someone bleeding out, their life slipping out of their grip
