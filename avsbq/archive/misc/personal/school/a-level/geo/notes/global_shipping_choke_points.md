# Global shipping choke points

Global shipping routes are increasingly vulnerable to various threats and risks – from piracy to military conflicts, and to cyber threats due to the rapid digitalisation of supply chains and port infrastructures.

Up to 80% of world trade is conducted via sea. Within these sea routes lie several chokepoints (see map) which are of immense importance within the global system.


Most of these choke points are narrow shipping lanes with high traffic volumes due to their strategic location and hence face security problems and cross-border terrorism threats.

Recently, Yemen's Houthi militia have been targeting vessels in the southern Red Sea and the Bab al-Mandab Strait in attacks that the Iran-backed group state aim to support the Palestinian cause during the Israel/Hamas war in Gaza.

The Bab al-Mandab Strait lies close to another significant chokepoint – the Suez Canal. This had serious issues when the Ever Given container vessel ran aground in March 2021, blocking the canal, and affecting over 400 ships.

Other major narrow passages and canals along busy sea routes include the Bosphorus connecting the Black and Mediterranean Seas, the Strait of Hormuz - the most important chokepoint that offers no alternative for ships in the Persian Gulf, the Strait of Malacca - the most important Asian chokepoint between the Persian Gulf and Asian destinations, and the Panama Canal connecting Asian countries with the West.

There are also secondary choke points that do have alternative shipping routes, which include the Strait of Magellan, the Strait of Dover, the Sunda Strait, and the Taiwan Strait.

The boundaries between global shipping routes and geopolitics are increasingly blurred. The geopolitical impact of a prolonged blockade, piracy, sudden incident, or military conflict can lead to shortages and a surge in food and energy prices.
