Assess the implications of this data for sustainability in areas of savanna grassland in east africa. Using
figure 12 shows a range of issues facing game parks and reserves in kenya east africa.
Data:
Tourism has beneficial impacts on the Serengeti’s sustainability by large yearly visitor profits *150
million, which may be used to fund upkeep and conservation of the Serengeti. Figure 12 shows that the
ratio of foreign visitors to Kenyan visitors is 14:11, the greater presence of foreigners may have a
favorable economic impact since international tourists may be higher spenders on guided
tours/packages. On the other hand, their larger presence may be regressive towards the Serengeti’s
sustainability, as they may be less attentive to their littler and nose pollution, which may alter migratory
patterns (stressing animals) and pollution. Revenues peaked in 2018, with 150 million and since 2015,
there has been year on year growth of 21%, with current trends suggesting this figure will only grow as
indicated by the constant rising limb. However, to counter-evaluate an extremely small percentile of this
figure filters down through to the local stakeholders, the indigenous tribes which maintain large
proportions of the land. In 2018 53% of tourist earnings went to large TNC’s who manage tourism and
with 35% going to the central Tanzanian government, meanwhile a potentially negligible figure went of
12% went to local people. Less funds directed to local landowners perhaps suggests in the future as
tourist numbers rise, they will be unable to treat issues such as tourist pollution and natural increases in
animal population. However, it can conversely be argued since stakeholders such as TNC and
government have a larger share in revenues, their self-interests will also be towards the sustainability of
the Serengeti, as the sustainability of it, will provide a constant income-source.
Within the figure we see that since 1977 cattle and sheep populations have increased around 1100%
since 1977. This has seen herders and agriculture farmers be pushed closer to the Western border of the
savanna ecosystem. This has for example, seen wildebeest retreat into more protected zones as they
look for more grassland to graze. From 1977 to 1977 wildebeest populations in the Masai Mara fell from
around 119,000 to 22,000. This is as a result of the wildebeest in the Serengeti and Masai Mara Game
Reserve being mostly migratory in their patterns. As the land they can migrate around has fallen this has
lead to overgrazing causing the land to be less able to sustain their populations. However, within the
Serengeti there is a core protected area in which no farming or poaching is allowed. This provides
habitat for the wildebeest. However, this core protected area is relatively small compared to the
previous area wildebeest used to have to migrate around – thus meaning it can only support a fraction
of the previous wildebeest population. Efforts creating larger buffer zones between the core protected
area have helped to minorly reduce the encroachment but does not appear to have had significant
impacts. In the long-term the large population growth within the Serengeti and Masai Mara regions is
likely to put greater pressures on farmers to illegally graze land further reducing the sustainability game
reserves in Kenya.
Tourist earnings cannot directly tackle larger problems such as global climate change. Global
temperatures increase by 1 degree each year and in the long run this may exacerbate ongoing
droughts/lead to out-of-control wildfires. The largest threat is rain pattern, the growing natural
population of both livestock and wildlife threatens migratory patterns, breeding seasons. 
As climate change in the Serengeti becomes more prominent, longer and more intense droughts will
become common, followed by periods of flooding thanks to excessive rain. Tourist earnings cannot
directly tackle such larger problems, global temperatures increasing by 1 degree each year may
exacerbate ongoing droughts and wildfires. Moreover, such disruptive rainfall may disrupt migratory
patterns and breeding seasons.
