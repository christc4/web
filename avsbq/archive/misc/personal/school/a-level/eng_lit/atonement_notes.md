Robbie’s social upstart, dismissed as a mere “hobby”.
Page 170 – Constantly alludes to the bildungsroman
Chapter 8
“This torture was his punishment for breaking the ridiculous vase”
Robbie’s intellect is his transgression.
The diction of “wet” in Robbie’s letter shows it as the most prescient htought
Page 82 “Malvolio” - determinism
“a fantastic abuse of hospitality”
Page 131 All of this comes to nothing -
“country house, prolepsis, determinism, reflexive novel”
Part 2:
Introduction: Two major crimes were committed, the rap£ of Lola and the subsequent lying
towards the police, which perverted the course of justice.
Paragraph 1: It can be argued that.
Conducting a background check.
In page 211, briony shows a readiness to atone, both legally and morally
Cecelia notes briony had no reason to give up her comfy life
“silly little hysterical girl”-> letters -> verisimulitude
Page 209 – cecelia is free
Lola's trajectory is changed and cecelia is almost sidelined.
Cursory observation of p.marshall as cruel proper background checks are not conducted, his
behaviour is not investigated.
Irresponsible adults – essay
E.Tallis dismisses Robbie as a “hobby of Jack’s” -> repressed classist attitude, coincides strongly
with “often used phrase”, “nothing good will come out of it”, convinces herself through the
repetitive nature that Robbie cannot be viewed positively (inference). This prejudice renders
her and the upper class incapable of seeing him as anything but a criminal.
What is foremount to people’s judgement of Marshall is his class, this view gains further
prescience when he is even considered as a “good-suitor”, “it was a pity about his face”. “cruel
overpopulated face”. No background check is conducted, the same level of scrutin and
investigation Robbie unfortunately places has not been placed on Marshall. McEwan perhaps
harkens this to the epigraph where he quotes from N.Abbey, “What have you been judging
from, consult your own observation”.
“It doesn’t look to bad”, “How on earth did they do that” Lola whispers, “I don’t know” - clear
lack of adult intervention into telltale signs of abuse, this allows Marshalls crime to effectively
go unnoticed, it is unchallenged.
Atonement
“Take the Girl out of Essex but not Essex out the girl” -> links to determinism.
Frustrations materialise in the war-setting, through abuse targetted towards the RAF man, who
becomes help-manifest. “Everyone had suffered” - indicates collateral damage, some
characters are sidelines and through the beatdown of the RAF man, their sufferings and anguish
can be realised. “And now someone was going to pay, he was answerabe for”
In some ways, Briony very much invents this character as a placeholder of how she views
Robbie, when the consequences of Marshall’s crime begins to unfold, Robbie is the immediate
scapegoat, perhaps harkening back to determinism and the class differences, which are akin to
the RAF man’s physical description singling him out as an “outsider”,
Indeed, chaotic war settings faciliate chaos, the burning boats bear semblance to the mimiced
setting of the tallis, unbearable heat, bodies pressing in war, and robbie pressing,
Friendly, fire, yet interestingly enough robbie rescues him, highlighting the ultimate goodness
within him, inclusiveity of the phrase “everyone had suffered”.
