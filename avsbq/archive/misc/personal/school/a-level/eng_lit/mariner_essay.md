“The Mariner isn’t a criminal at all: he only shoots a bird”
One interpretation is that, due to the unconventional nature of the crime, the
absence of a legal system (court of law), conviction and motive it is implausible to
ascribe the mariner with the title “criminal”. However, two opposing textual
readings suggest the Mariner is not simply “shooting a bird” he shoots a visage of
Christ himself, he need not be tried conventionally as he commits a crime against
God. Moreover, it can be argued that it is precisely the view that the Mariner
“only shoots a bird” which cements him as a criminal, through the eco-critical lens
as he commits a senseless crime. This essay will in turn explore each view, in
particular relation with Coleridge’s personal theological and world views to
suggest which is most significant.
Firstly, it can be argued that although some more conventional aspects of crime
I.e courtroom, motive and process of detection are either absent or not fully
explored, it cannot be denied that the presence of witnesses, the idea of criminal
conviction and sentencing are significant. Part II, where the shipmates cry out
against the mariner can be interpreted as them being witness to the “bird [being]
slay[ed]” to which they cried out “ah wretch!”. The transitive verb “slay” not only
captures the magnitude of the crime; the verb choice is more fitting for a human
rather than a bird of sea – yet it also serves as an eye-witness report of the crime
which had just taken place. Moreover, it can be argued the spirits in part V,
partially mimic courtroom proceedings of questions being raised, “is this the man,
by him who died on cross”, which suggest that through the eyes of the law, the
mariner can be viewed as a criminal. Furthermore, the contemporary concept of
criminal convictions/criminal records can be observed in a “frightful fiend doth
close behind him tread” which suggests his past, similar to a record, will always
follow him. Furthermore, an act of sentencing can be observed in “penance more
he will do”, which suggests that the spirits act as arbitrators of the law.
Secondly, it can be argued from a theological perspective, Coleridge is a criminal,
not necessarily in the eyes of human law, but in the eyes of God. Coleridge,
subscribed to a heretical version of “Christianity”, specifically Unitarianism, which
believed the universe conceived of as whole is God. Therefore, the act of killing an 
albatross, senselessly, is an attack on God. Moreover, the albatross who has a
“Christian soul”, can be read to be a visage of the Christ himself, which likens the
Mariner to those who killed Christ himself, solidifying him as a criminal in the
theological perspective.
Finally, this can be read through an eco-critical lens, to show his sheer disregard
for the environment, the Mariner mimics a “sport-killing”, which can be read as a
senseless crime against an animal. From the narrator’s perspective, it can be
inferred that his only reasoning for killing the albatross was that it was a nuisance,
“it ate the food it ne’er had eaten, and round and round it flew”, the repetition of
the visual verb “round” evokes a jarring scene towards readers. Thus, the mariner
while only “shooting a bird”, commits a crime against nature, as his only
justifiable excuse was that it had disturbed the crew.
In conclusion, the most significant interpretation is that the Mariner is a criminal
as the most obvious elements of crime such as criminal conviction, witnesses and
sentencing are present and point towards the mariner being convicted a criminal.
Although, the statement he only shots a bird has some truth to it, the theological
reading suggests he commits a grave crime against God, as the bird is Christ and
the eco-critical reading suggests he commits a senseless crime against nature.
