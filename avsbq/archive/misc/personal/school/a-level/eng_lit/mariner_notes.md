“Bird of good omen” Mariner disregards it, despite saving from “tyrannous storm”
Saved from the “tyrannous” storm
This perhaps mirrors the betrayal of Chrit by the disciple Judas.
This notion gains futher prescience, being developed by Coleride as the mariner notes that instead
“instead of the cross, the albatross about my neck was hung”
The hanging of the albatross symbolisin burderning guilt, guilt acts as a substitution of religious belief,
Creaates an implicit link between murder of god and the albatross.
Liminal, limbo-like-state, he passes
“pass like night, from land to land” his depection as a wanderer is reinforced to e gibbons, likens his
position to a stranger
“in the tradition of the wandering jew” comparison of the mariner to the israelites and their similar
punishment wandering restlessly,reinforces this notion.
“until my ghastly tale is told, this heart within me burns” - pathos? Injustice is punishment
disproportionate to the crime, in the 21
st century view? Mariner is constantly reliving his horrific ordeal
despite haivng “penance done”,, unlioke previous implications he now possesses a “heart”
Water, water, everywhere, any drop to drink, with throats unslaked with black lips baked.
Psychological punishements “slimty things” taunt him prevent him from redeeming himself, praing
The mariner only uses the identifier “things” to suggest these supposesed creatures are merely an
extension of his imagination
Marinre “skinny old hand” fragility, “glittering eye”
Use aural, olfactory
At the “hollo” of the mariners the bird arrives for food play and vespers, inextricable connection
outlined by coleridege, the bird has with the natural environment, it appears even through the snow
fog, its arrival coinciding with the environement, coincides with a “thunder-fit” which enables or allws
the crew to steer the ship out of the hellish “land of ice”, it is thus benevolent friend of man,
disturbances onloy occur after the bird is shot.
Coleridge uses the structure of his verse in order to mirror the way the ship is surrounded by the
agonising temptation of undrinkable water, the line descrbing the boards of the ship that “shrink” from
dehydryation, is positioned between two lines describing the “water water everywhere” marginal gloss
makes it clear that this point at which the albatross begins to be avenged,
The food arrives for food bird ans vspers, colerdige clearly illustrates the birds inextricable connection to
its natural environment it appears through the snow fog and its arrival coincides with a thunder-fit that
allows the crew to steer the ship out of the hellfish, “land of cie”, the bird is positioned as coleridge as a
benevolent friend of man, and that the disturbances to the natural world after the albatross is shot

“God himself scarced” - highlights God’s absecnce which is contradictory to Coleridge’s pan-theistic
world view.

Repurpose
The repetition of alone, highlights constrained diction, but also is a sign of physical entrapment

God's love is manifest through the restoration of
order, harkens back to Coleridge’s belief on
pantheism.
God’s anger materialises in the setting and

Two opposing textual readings,
Conventional aspects of crime are either absent or not
fully explored,.
“Mariner isn’t a criminal, only shoots a bird” - essay
Shipmates crying out againt mariner -> witness to
“bird being slayn” to which they cry out “ah
wretch!” -> crewmates outcry justifies the position, it
is not just a bird, coleridge shapes meaning through
the transitive superlative verb “slay” which captures
magnitude of the crime – textual critics may argue
coleridge purposefully uses verb choice more
appropriate for human –than bird of sea – to clearly
demonstrate the magnittude of his crime, further
reinstating the notion that this is not just a bird.
Crewmen are eye-witness accounts.
Moreover, spirits in part v, partially mimic courtroom
proceedings of questions being raised “is this the man,
by him who died on cross” through the eyes of the
law, mariner is a criminal. - are they arbitrators of the
law?
Contemporary concept of permanent criminal
convictions/records is observable in the phrase
“frightful fiend doth close behind him tread” suggests
a record of his crime will follow him. “Penance more
he will do” suggests that sentencing is applied.
Mariner effectivley mimics a senseless crime, the
justification motive which can be observed can be
seen as a nuisance it had “eaten food, round and
round it flew” the repetition of the visual verb, evokes
a jarring scene towards the reader,
Although, within the opposing statement, lies truth, it
“Mariner victim essay”
Upon first reading, it can be seen that, bird arrives for
food prayer and vespers. Perhaps, Coleridge through
language purposely through verb choice likens the
albatross to another crew member, later ascribed to
be a “christian soul”, it is not inferrable that the bird
was trespassing as it was regarded as good omen. 
Arrived came to the mariners hello. This coincides
strongly with personal belief. Ice did split with a
thunder fit. Constant collateral victims.
