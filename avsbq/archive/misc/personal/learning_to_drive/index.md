### introduction

highway code applies to england, scotland and wales

### wording of the highway code

most rules in the code are legal requirments, breaking them means you've committed a criminal offense

you may be fined, given penalty points on your licence or disqualified from driving. in the seriousmost cases you can be sent to prisoon

such rules are identified by use of words '*must/must not*'. 

failure to comply with the other rules of the code, will not in itself cause you to be prosecuted. the code  may be used in evidence in any court proceedings under the traffic acts to establish liability. this includes rules which use advisory wording such as 'should/should not' or 'do/do not'


### hierarchy of road users 

concept that places those road users most at risk in event of a collision at the hierarchy's top. the hierarchy doesn't remove the nee for everyone to behave responsibly. road users most likely to be injured in a collision are pedestrians, cyclists, horse riders, motorcyclists - with children, older adults and disabled people being more at risk.

#### rule h1

important that all road users are aware of the highway code, are considerate to other road users and understand their responsibility for the safety of others.

always remember that the people you have encountered may have impaired sight, hearing or mobility and that this may not be obvious.
