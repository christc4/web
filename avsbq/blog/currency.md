Launched in a bid to boost local trade, the Exeter pound was only accepted by a number of local shops - designed to work alongside and not replace sterling

Daniel Hillier, who is one of the directors, said: "Shoppers tend to go to big name brands and we want to try to educate them to shop at the small, independent businesses.

"Certain businesses will be offering deals, like 5 or 10 percent off if you use the currency."

The first note was spent by Exeter's lord mayor outside the city's cathedral

What went wrong for it? It was launched when the world was on the cusp of a contactless revolution

In April 2016, the Exeter Pound launched a bid to go digital. A Crowdfunder raised £6,800 to develop a digital currency but without a regulatory body to set out its useage and distribution, along with the likes of Bitcoin, the Exeter Pound wasn’t able to take the next leap.

Mr Martin said: “It has been a lot of hard work and there might be a time when there is a digital currency framework, when it might rise again, but for now it is a relief. If we could not progress it we felt we should bring it to an end.”

The Exeter Pound works by exchanging £sterling 1:1 for £E at nine exchange points and spending with 165 independent traders throughout the city.
