# Internet landmines 

*Last update: 2024/09/22* 

I originally wrote this with the premise that todays children setting foot in the web are unknowingly walking across landmines - with the meat of this post being how to protect them from harms way.

And thoughts being thoughts... all come knocking on  my door just as I'm about to wrap things up, so all-in-one blog post, you get to know some good 'parental-controls', a rant and more

## The Modern-Web

In prehistoric times, evils  forces like centralization, censorship and moral degeneracy hadn't fully seeded itself in the web.  You could've treated the web like a library waiting for readers to come flocking in - the only invisible hand moving you towards different on theshelf was your own interest.

Having touched upon Adam Smith's 'invisible hand', let me propose some alternatives to giving your children free-rein where the algorithm could steer them...

This is a shell script [The Ultimate Way of Browsing Channels](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/voidrice/pull/1320). As the author puts it

> _"No browsers, accounts, distractions, crappy algorithm and recommendations, advertisements, sponsors, intros, outros, fillers or empty spaces. We eliminate them all"_

You won't have to cross your fingers your kids don't encounter this!

## Centralised or Decentralised

Common people are more impressed if you design a platform as algorithmically and systematically as can be. They will believe more in it. The more it mimicks the society they live, the more invested they will be in it. If you can replicate the congregration of people in a town square - agglomerate it into smooth scrollable interface, you've created magic. 

This digitial town square, by nature, sounds very 'centralised' right?

But beyond the crowds of people, 'centralised' in this instance refers to 'central' authority responsible for safeguarding users, enforcing rules and the general maintenance of  the town center.

For us in today's world, a decentralized society would be total anarchy, chaos manifest.

What direct comparison can we draw to real life - what society has no government to pave the roads, patch up the potholes, feed the poor and care for the sick. Well just like how the web is magic, magic makes decentralisation easier.

But what happen's when you get kicked out of said town told to pack up your soapbox and take  to the road?

The newly exiled may float in and out of other towns finding signs akin to the "No Irish, No Blacks, No Coloured' but pertaining to his particular strain of thought. Maybe he will band together with other exiles, and this exodus will start a new platform and we are back to the town square.

## Who else is in the town square?

Laxed laws and fear have gotten most of the townsfolk turning a blind eye and those in authority ready to bring out the most deranged of dungeonfolk out into sunlight. Same, with all platforms. 

If you see where I'm getting at, you're probably ready to write this article of as one that presents a zero-sum game and doesn't say anything new.

I have a solution and I'd like you to consider it.

Remember that invisible force I described earlier how about you see it as an invisible hand, the algorithm, systematicall designed to push down ones throat

## What is a site

Most sites are glorified chainlinks - their primary function being the showing of a video for example, with many additions packaged in. Such as a comment and recommended section.

Knowing that - why don't the exiles have their own platform 

YouTube would funtion exactly the same for ninety percent of its viewers, if all it was a search bar, that spat out exactly what you put in. 

In short, when you access their site, you want to get from point A to B, video you want to watch comes to mind, you land on site

Nick Fuentes has his own platform, cozy.tv and Luke Smith has his own peertube instance
