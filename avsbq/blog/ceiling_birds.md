The smoke alarm.. it's like chinese water torture

My new bride girdled to the red string of fate

Woe betide he who points out the chirp,
Woe befall on that little twirp,
Woe befall on the lie and disguise,
Wise words deludes the skies inside,
Woe belies on the comfort they nurse,
Woe betwixt such nights I can't catch a peep,
Where danger hides close, but shun he who speak,
Woe behest the silence they keep!
For the beeping grows louder, yet words remain weak
Woe beseech they who slumber in peace,
Woe beget fate which they will ignore,
The sound of the chirp which warns from the core,
For the lie whispers calm, while the flames seek the door,
And woe shall awaken too late to implore

Crappy poems aside, smoke detector beeping is a real issue.

The cycle of rebirth


todo This was a meme back in the 90's and early 00's, too. Especially on Loveline, the radio show where teens and young people called in to discuss relationship problems. The callers often had smoke detectors with low batteries periodically going off in the background. It was so common, Loveline had a reoccurring bit where one of the hosts would make the caller shut up so they could time the beeps and predict them. The host would often joke that a lizard in a cage would try to kill itself if it was subjected to the beeping, but their callers somehow managed to ignore it.
