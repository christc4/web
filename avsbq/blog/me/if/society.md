# If ... society

A wife and husband set out for voyage together, trailing behind is their Priest and his wife.

Before setting of, all four confess their sins and receive a blessing from their bishop.

They camp outside for several days, lighting a flare to signal to the neighbouring village they are nearby.

Today is a day of fasting and while camped out the neighbouring village's priest and bishop ride out on horseback, they hear the confessions and bless them with holy water. After saying some prayers they approach the village.

Their town's iconographers have worked to create a magnificent icon of the Anunciation, and both villages clergy, lead it first into the village and the priests deliver it to the local Church.

They communicate with Folksprak, the lingua-franca for their continent. They dismount and greet the villagers warmly.

The journey was long and arduos so they head to the bathhouse where they clean.

The next day consists of discussions regarding the future of their trade relationship.


Tao Te Ching - Lao Tzu - chapter 80



"A small country has fewer people.

Though there are machines that can work ten to a hundred times faster than man, they are not needed.

The people take death seriously and do not travel far.

Though they have boats and carriages, no on uses them.

Though they have armor and weapons, no one displays them.

Men return to the knotting of rope in place of writing.

Their food is plain and good, their clothes fine but simple, their homes secure;

They are happy in their ways.

Though they live within sight of their neighbors,

And crowing cocks and barking dogs are heard across the way,

Yet they leave each other in peace while they grow old and die."

 @Charlie_Yu  a great translation generally, but I think it downplays the last line, which says something like 'even though a neighboring country is in sight, and they can hear each-other's dogs and chickens, until they grow old and die, they do not come or go toward each-other', or 'they grow old and die without visiting each-other' which I ought to be interpreted as different from just leaving 'each-other in peace'

Lao Tzu.  Here is the quote: 《老子》第八○章：「鄰國相望，雞犬之聲相聞，民至老死不相往來。」
