# Bespoke in Bangladesh

*Last update: 2024/09/07*

Suits aren't a thing in Bangladesh.

Bengali's don't know suits. The British know suits. The Italians and Japanese know suits.

That's not to say there aren't talented tailoring houses dotted around the capital - well... in the well-to-do areas. 

You have to be ultra-specific and you're better talking to an older and more-travelled tailor.

Make sure they don't use any fusing or glue in the construction, go for a pure cotton no blended synthetics.
