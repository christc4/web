Some time in early 2023, Got this email, from Student Beans a company that has codes for student discounts.

They are offering discounts for s&ast;x toys.

Love  honey was founded by two Brits, Neal Slateford and Richard Longhurst 

They are responsible for one in three s&ast;x toys sold in the UK - with one of their most popular being the 'Great American Challenge', a 32-inch dil&ast;o.

This email being sent out en-masse to university students.

Many kids create Google accounts with fake ages, this is probably harder now as Google uses id verification or they might be using someone elses account, and assume the ad offering free toys is referring to kids toys..
