> Christ is the only exit from this world. All other exits - sexual rapture, political utopia, economic independence - are but blind alleys in which rot the corpses of many who have tried them- Fr. Seraphim Rose

> It's trivial for God to reveal secrets such as new technology or other secrets and cause insane price disturbances and throw the whole world into complete chaos - Terry Davis

Math is a playground, God gave humans to keep us from being bored

All art is applied mathematics, 

Man-made gyms, server rooms, communes
