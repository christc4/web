# How to simplify a program

## Webdev

- logic
	- everything mentioned below to 'filter out' requires too much logic

- robots.txt
	- instructions for search engine scrapers
	- which URLS the crawler can access
	- so as to not overload the site with requests

- RSS
	- No need for a YouTube and some social media accounts
	- Notified of blog posts

- searchbars
	- cat-v.org fake searchbar

- sitemap
	- XML has its own sitemaps
	- XML is used for RSS feeds
	- XML makes information machine-readable. XML sitemaps provide search engines with an efficient list of the URLs on a site

- markdown
	- Setex style headers ( using '=' sign several times under a header )
	- atx-style headers, increment depending on no. of pound sign/hashtag 

- http/https
	- [Dan Luu](https://danluu.com/web-bloat/)	
	- someone linked cat-v on an arch linux forum, and this idiot started saying he wont click on it

- why dont people minify it more?
	- its like painting your houuse and someone tells you, can do it better

## UNIX

- [origin of dot files?](http://95.179.238.202/archive/cs/os/unix/history/dot_files)

- [vim golf](https://www.vimgolf.com/)

- Why not scripting?
	- GNU cat vs Plan9 cat

uses for server side scripting
