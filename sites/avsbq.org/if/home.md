# If ... home 

> Go to [black dolphin](http://to-do.avsbq.org/black_dolphin) to see if I live out my dream

### Climate

Cold enough to ward of tourists.

Warm enough to feel my face and for food to grow

### Defenses

Lots of guard-dogs on my property to alert me to the slightest disturbances and be my foot soldiers.

House built a top a small mound, so I have some height advantage

### Location

Somewhere far-far-far away.

Preferably in a wooded/forested area and ideally located near springs/river/running water.
