That's right. No

- keybindings
- bookmarks
- tabs
- history
- address bar
- password management
- pdf viewer

I want it all managed externally.

I would like an easy way to define universal css for every page, like how you can in Surf
Sort of how you achive tabbing in Surf with suckless' program &apos;tabbed&apos;. Or how you can patch the st terminal to support scrollback. Or how bspwm does keybinding with sxhkd. Although I don't want to have to patch programs. I want nothing baked in the source code.

All I want my browser to do is display HTML/CSS pages and work with Javascript.

I want documents like pdfs to be downloaded and stored in /tmp and opened with adocument viewer like 'zathura'

This is a given but also no "user reports" for bugs/crashes etc, I want to be able to individually submit an issue on the git page. It also has to be 100% free software, that's free as in _libre_ not free as in _gratis_.
