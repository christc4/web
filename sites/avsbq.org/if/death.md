# If I die

*Last update: 2024/09/07*

<s>I hit the kill switch before I see the lights, taking out with me avsbq.org and all its subdomains ~</s>

I like to think, I've briefed my friends enough, regarding the maintenance of my site/s... its upkeep, if it goes down etc. 

If they are incapable of being its caretaker, I'll probably come back to haunt them

I also like to think all of my belongings will be distributed to the right people/organisation's

<details><summary>Unfurl for a poem</summary>
Do not stand at my grave and weep,
I am not there, I do not sleep.
I am a thousand winds that blow;
I am the diamond glints on the snow.
I am the sunlight on ripened grain;
I am the gentle autumn's rain.
When you awaken in the morning's hush,
I am the swift uplifting rush
Of quiet birds in circled flight.
I am the soft star that shines at night.
Do not stand at my grave and cry.
I am not there; I did not die.

## The long and dry

Okay turns out dying unexpectedly requires months of planning beforehand. Lot's of sundry things to do

Such as my most precious belongings and electronics, who do I have them distributed to? I need to make a document with *pictures* of my belongings

I need to also have my Priest notified.

Also extremely difficult to discuss the practical aspect with people you know, either they want to be _cryptic_ and _cool_ giving you stupid vampirish responses or are extremely shy and coy about the topic.
