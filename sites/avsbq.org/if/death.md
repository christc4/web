# If I die

<s>I hit the kill switch before I see the lights, taking out with me avsbq.org and all its subdomains ~</s>

I like to think, I've briefed my friends enough, regarding the maintenance of my site/s... its upkeep, if it goes down etc. 

If they are incapable of being its caretaker, I'll probably come back to haunt them

I also like to think all of my belongings will be distributed to the right people/organisation's but frankly I don't even know where's what, so I need to make a list with pictures of where I want all my things to go
