# Batch gif background color removal

*Last update: 2024/09/13*

*Note to reader:* this will have a highly rarified use case. I used this for .gifs I originally downloaded from [chineseconverter.com](https://www.chineseconverter.com/en/convert/chinese-stroke-order-tool) as they didn't offer a transparent .gif option. You can find the gifs I used this script to batch convert [here](http://language.avsbq.org/cn/sentence_mining.html)

*Dependencies:*

- bash
- [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/index.php)

There are probably sites that can do the same thing, but probably cannot automate it, say you have a hundred gifs..
