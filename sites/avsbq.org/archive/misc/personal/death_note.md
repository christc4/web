# Death note

2024/09/29

Principled none the less

Were my life to be examined under a microscope

Doomed to be a mere footnote in the pages of history, not even 

I don't know if my life has achieved merit

It will however be the last time I trouble any human being. I feel I am on a sickbed frow which I shall never get up

I look for the resurrection of the dead and the life to come
