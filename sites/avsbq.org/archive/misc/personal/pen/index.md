# Pen

I think an interest in 'pens' especially 'fountain pens' is a superfluous hobby just as bad as 'mechanical keyboard' people.

But - I was in both camps, now I will tell you all about my thoughts on pens.

I have a review on Muji pen, [read here]
I think this is good - but quality control issue

## Closing word

I don't care enough about pens, fountain pen is best but you can't just hand fountain pen to people - they will unscrew fiddle, put too much pressure and somehow have ink all over their hands
