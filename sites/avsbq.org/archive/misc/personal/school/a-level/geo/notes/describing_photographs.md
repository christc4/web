How to describe photographs?

- Name/identify what you're looking at
- Write what it look like
	- 'paint a picture' in words
- State what it is made of
- State its size
	- give some sense of scale
- State the context in which the feature is found
	- called the 'field relationship'
	- they are data elements that establish connections and dependencies between different objects to create meaningful and insightful views
- look for some variation in the photograph
	- look for an anomaly

## Describing places by text

Figure 1 shows a *small* (spatial) *coastal village* which *hugs the shoreline* of an inlet (identified field/relationship). *Most* of the *buildings* around the *coastal edge) are *4 storeys high* with *some* a *little higher*. They are coloured white, yellow and peach. There is a church behind the central building at a height just above the level of the rest of the settlem.nt. The size of the village is only about 1km in length and about 500m in width. There is a small square at the head of the inlet (field relationship), the latter being full of small boats and a few yachts. The boats look quite expensive.

The ground floor of many of the building on the waterâ€™s edge have awnings which suggests they are shops, cafes, or restaurants, which then suggest this is a tourist place. The number of boats and yachts reinforce this view. (More picture-painting)

Finally, the village is surrounded by steep wooded slopes, though there are isolated large houses set into this woodland. These are clearly separate from the main village but want to be close to it. (Variation/anomaly)
