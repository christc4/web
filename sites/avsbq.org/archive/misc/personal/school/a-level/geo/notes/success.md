# Success in geography!

- Zai farming
	- Yatenga villages, in North Serengeti
	- Land restoration in semi-arid drylands and saw an increase in soil fertility
	- Some tribal chiefs were hostile to the idea of Zai, so intially it was conducted in secret on an extremely small scale

- Urban change
	- Ouahigouva, Olympic Park Woodberry Wetlands (LWT)
	- Urban expansion in brownfield areas, regeneration,
	- Park employees were hired, fenced areas

- Species reintroduction
	-  Australia, cane toads. Yellowstone, grey wolves. (1995)
	- Resulted in a trophic cascade
	- _"Powerful indirect interactions control entire ecosystems - predators limit density/behaviour of preys - thereby enhancing survival of next lower trophic levels"_
	- 8 wolves were initially introduced to carefully observe how the ecosystem would react


- Unplanned introduction of species
	- Upper midwest, greatlakes region of the USA
	- Ring necked parakeets and Asian carp
	- Asian carp are known to uproot vegetation and create muddy water though their habit of rooting in the mud for food, they are thought often to have detrimental effects on native species. Negative impact on the emphatic zone. 
	- From 2010 to January 2019, Illinois contrat fishermen have harvested 7.5 million pounds of Asian Carp from the Illinois river, most of the haul is used to make fertiliser and pet food
