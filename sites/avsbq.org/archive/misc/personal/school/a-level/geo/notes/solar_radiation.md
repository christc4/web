Solar Radiation and Equator: Solar radiation refers to the energy emitted by the sun in the form of electromagnetic waves. The amount of solar radiation received varies across the Earth's surface due to the curvature of the Earth. At the equator, solar radiation is most intense because the sun is directly overhead for a significant portion of the year. This means that sunlight hits the Earth's surface more directly at the equator compared to other latitudes.

Oblique Rays and Increasing Latitude: As you move away from the equator towards the poles, the angle at which the sun's rays hit the Earth's surface becomes more oblique. This is due to the curvature of the Earth. When sunlight strikes at a more oblique angle, it is spread out over a larger area, resulting in less concentrated energy per unit area. As a consequence, more of the incoming radiation is either reflected back into space or absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere before reaching the surface as you move towards higher latitudes.

Tilt of Earth's Axis and Tropics: The Earth's axis is tilted relative to its orbit around the sun. This axial tilt is responsible for the changing seasons. At certain times of the year, the sun is directly over different latitudes. For example, during the summer solstice, the sun is directly over one of the tropics (either the Tropic of Cancer or the Tropic of Capricorn, depending on the time of year). This direct overhead position of the sun at the tropics contributes to the seasonal variations in temperature and weather patterns.
