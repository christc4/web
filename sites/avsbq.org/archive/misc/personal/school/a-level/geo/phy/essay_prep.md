### Farming practice

When soil is ploughed, its layers invert, air mixes and microbial activity increases, organic matter broken down more rapidly, Largest source of carbon emissions within agriculture is enteric fermentation - rice paddies

Boisenaro encouraged deforestation and logging during is pressidency,

### Global warming

Increased carbon dioxide leads to an increase in evaporation, which leads to an increase in water vapour, a greenhouse gas,

Since there is a time lag between carbon dioxide increases and rise in temperatures, difficult to calculate SR vs LR

When carbon dioxide releases into the atmosphere from the ocean, it creates what is called a positive atmospheric flux. A negative flux refers to the ocean absorbing carbon dioxide. Think of these fluxes as an inhale and an exhale, where the net effect of these opposing directions determines the overall effect.

Carbon capture is inacessible to LICS, development cannot be decoupled from environmental degredation.

Due to cattle trampling, wind blown seeds find it hard to establish themselves

If there is flooding roots cannoth anchor from soil, to protect it from any ulluvial erosion
Rain reduces the microbial activity, this is rainsplash impact, rainwater in surface depressions is harmful
*Spatially*, the Amazon is the largest rainforest *globally*, wherein an area the *size of Wales* is deforested *each year*; being repurposed for anthropogenic activities such as: cattle ranching and logging. A repurcussion of this is the natural water cycle being disturbed. Impermeable surfaces, such as the compression of soils from repeated machinery and livestock, reduce soil porosity, which in turn reduces levels of interception and causes flooding.

### Freeze thaw weathering

Freeze thaw weathering, is when rainwater seeps into cracks and joints within the geological strata, wherein it freezes at sub-tero temperature, which the ice increases by 10% in size, causing the roc to shatter, which is exacerbated by high durnal ranges.

### Climate change

Climate change is a change in *global* or *regional* climate patterns. This has been argued to have accelerated with *80ppm of Co2* be8ng released in the *last 50 years* causing the elvel of Co2 to reace over *400* ppm in the atmosphere.

If mitigation of climate change isn't taken the argued tipping point to which the effects are irreversible is by *20230* this can be seen within the cited region of the maldivers where of 200 of their 1200 islands are inhabitle due to sea level rise, the maldives could be wiped out by 2080.

### Explain role of cryospheric change in the water cycle

The cryosphere refers to the major storage of water in the form of ice approximately 1.7%. The cryosphere affects the water cycle by maintaining sea levels. For example, during interglacial warming periods, melting takes place adding water to hydrospheric stores such as... Which in turn causes an increased input of water into the ocean stroage meaning sea level rise both due to increased volume and thermal expansion.

Because ice decreases albedo effect and thermal expansion, converse of claical periods, latent heat of freezing , and talk about permathroust.

Cryospheric change has a regulatory role in sea levels, in a period of cooling (glacias period) the cryosphere can grow in sive, as the water cycle is slowed considerably as the ice restricts the return of water to the sea and ocean, vice versa during periods of warming the cryosphere will add water to the cycle, as the water cycle restarts more of the ice melts and returs water to the sea, this increases the sive of the ocean store causing sea levels to rise throughd increased volumes of wmatetr.

### Explain the concept of dynamic equillibrium in relation to the water cycle

- Dynamic equllibrium, lacj of change in a system, inputs and outputs in xalance, if changes over eehback allows for correlation


- Closed system, where no mater leave-\ekits but energy is transyerred\ no water is added to the global budget, closed system of linked processes.

Dynamic equillibrium refers to the tendency towards a natural state of balance within the hydrological cyle, which is closed , no water is added or leazes the global water budget, water is simply recycled around the system.

The dynamic equillibrium, is easily upset by extreme weather events such as stroms or even huban activity e.g modifyinfg the dynamic equillibrium. This in turn causes disruption and inteference to the dynamic equillibrium and is evidenced through flooding, such events and processes cause sudden changes in the state of the system.

Note: the drainage basin element of the hydrological cycle is the open system where the inputs and outputs can change.

Is the carbon cycle closed?

This is *evidenced* by months such as, *provide examples*, which also indicates biggest increases around 4mm,

However, *contrary to the pattern*, from *MONTH* to *MONTH* the model suggests that rainfall will be lower than the *DATA* average by as much as *DATA* in *MONTH*.

THIS map gives further information about how changes identified may affect rainfall spatially across africa

### A six marker,

Prolonged periods of rainfall prior to a strom appear to have contributed to the impact of antecedent rainfall. This antecedent rainfall leads to full storage in ground water and in the soil. Saturated groundwater prior to this event has exacerbated the impact of the storm. this almost certainly speeds up overland flow
surface runoff during the storm.

Rock type and gradient lead to the hydrograph flashiness.

An increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide can in turn cause higher rates of evapotranspiration.
Through photosynthesis water influences CO2 absorption through atmospheric store to biosphere.
Water can transfer CO2 from atmosphere to lithosphere/hydrosphere through precipitation in the form of acid rain, in the oceans this thien becomes carxbonic acid.

Amazon rainforest trees intercept 75% of rainfall, ald send it backto the atmosphere, they also absorb co2 and store it. For decomosiion to ocean, water is needed by the decomposers. decompositin is essential for the transfer of carbon from previously locked iomass,it to the atmosphere, which in turn allows for nutrient cycling e.g. in the amazon which suports growth of new plants, 50% of tree bark is in co2


### Food for thought

One may challenge the theme of _the interrelatedness of the carbon and water cycle_. Elements of the water cycle are not inter-related to the carbon cycle. At its core basic elements involve the transfer of water through the lithosphere, hydro/cryo + atmosphere, this is entirely driven by energy and gravity -> independent of the carbon cycle.

drainage basin water balance

this is the balance between inputs and outputs of a drainage basin

water balance is expressed as:
balance between inputs and outputs of a drainage basin, water balance

p = q + e (+/- change in storage)

where p = precipitation
q = runoff
e = evapotranspiration

Rivers will always have a regime they follow, in that some months the discharge of the river will be higher than others. The water balance looks at hov the amount of precipitation compares with the water leaving the system as runoff or as evapotranspiration, the balance will change throughout the year and will be affected by the overall climate of the area near to the river.

For example, under usual conditions the precipitation will be matched by runoff and evapotranspiration giving a 'normal' river level. If evapotranspiration becomes greater for a few months in summer while precipitation and runoff remain the same the river will flow between normal level.

water surplus, there is excess water available within the system, this occurs when precipitation exceeds evapotranspiration and the excess is not being used by plants

deficiency, there is a reduction of water available within the system occurs when ev exceeds precipitation

recharge after a period of deficiency precipitation will occur and replace the lost water in the soil this needs to occur before a period of surplus can reoccur

field capacity the maximum amount of water that soir can hold before it becomes saturated

a water surplus can result in wet soils high river levels and additional runoff whereas a deficit leads to dry soil falling river levels and possibly a drier micro climate.

Predicte impacts of climate change, caused by changes in the cabron budget on this region include the following, firstly an increase in temperature of 2-3c by 2050, which is likely to reuslt in increased rates of evapotranspiratin and a more vigourous hydrological cycle. sea temperatures are exptected to warm too, praticularly in the pacific ocean, this will have a knock on effect o the el nino southern oscialation, which is likely to occur more fruequently

Secondly a decrease in precipiatin durin gthe dry season which can last up to four months of the year is expcected. Reduced rainfall and prolonged drought are features of an el nino year and these could therefore be experienced more frequently, it is also possile that there will be more intense rainfall during the wet season.

### Carbon and water cycle


##### A basic carbon cycle explanation

Atmospheric carbon is uptaken through photosynthesis by vegetation, above ground carbon stores include stem, branches and foliage. Some carbon is internally transferred from above-ground to below-ground carbon soils. Fallen leaves and branches add carbon to soils, yet carbon is lost back into the atmosphere through respiration and decomposition of organic matter, such as soil respiration

Below ground carbon consists of roots, litter, some carban is transferred from below ground carbon for example root mortality to the soils, soil carbon, organic, inorganic


#### Carbon cycle

Greenhouse gases absorb infared heat energy, and contribute to radiative forcing, more sunlight is taken in than reflected



Historically, the cambrian period was 500 million years ago and there was 7000ppm, yet this has sunk to 180ppm during  the quaternary glaciation, nowadays 800 GtC 280ppm to 4000ppm as seen by the carbon observatory, before exams look at keeling curve

##### Carbon sequestration

Geological sequestration, is when carbon is injected in liquid form into stores underground, depleted oil reservoirs, oceans or old coal mines, however this is still at an experimental stage,

There are difficulties in the sealing of mines. In

Still very experimental technology, road tankers, ships, all still emit greenhouse gases via road emissions, supercriticial highly pressurised is injected, very dangerous

The benefits are that ocean carbon is 'sunk' within weeks however the circulation system takes thouasands of years for it to return to the atmosphere

Biological/terrestrial sequestration, plants capture carbon from redwood trees,
##### Oceanic carbon pumps

Water is ablo to dissolve carbon dioxide, there is a negative correlation between the temperature of the water and the amount of carbon dioxide that can be dissolved. This leads to vertical deep mixing, a term used to describe the most important movement of carbon dioxide in oceans, It occurs when warm water in oceanic surface currents is carried from the warm tropics to the cold polar regions. Here the water is cooled, making it dense enough to sink below the surface layer, sometimes all the way to the ocean bed. When cold water returns to the surface and warms up again, it loses carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. In this fashion, vertical circulation ensures that carbon dioxide is constantly being exchanged between the ocean and the atmosphere. This vertical circulation also acts as an enormous carbon pump, giving the ocean a lot more carbon than it would have if this surface water was not being constatly replenished.

Carbon dioxide can be removed from atmosphere by dissolving in water forming, humans can anthropogenically do this carbonic acid plus water equals acid rain

Phytoplankton in euphotic zone, convert carbon into organic matter, through photosynthesis, this then releases oxygen as a by-product

It can be argued that plants respiring from an increase in co2, oxygen releases. However it is important to realises  that respiration nullifies this,  plants rely on phosphorus nitrogen and sulphur, an increase in carbon dioxide is meaningless if other sources are exhausted,

##### Vertical deep mixing

Warm water in oceanic surface currents, carries warm tropics water to cold polar regions, water is cooled, making it denser and sinks to the ocean bed, when this returs to the surface is loses carbon dioxide to the atmospheric store, carbon pump takes co2 to the ocean depth
Co2 is found in soils, atmosphere and oceans, methane is found in sedimentary rocks and permafrost.
Carbon escapes from mantles at constructive and destructive plate boundaries as well as hot-spot volcanoes, derived from metamorphism of carbonate rocks subducting with ocean crust.

The twilight zone has 37100 gtc

Carbon dioxide naturally returns without humans, tectonic forces continetal margins released also in hot springs

##### In defense of forest fires,

Old trees will leave healthy ash, this organic soil layer accumalates carbon

##### Global warming

Urban heat island effect, cities are responsible for 47 percent of

Carbon dioxide is removed into long-term storage by burial of sedimentary rock layers and carbonate rocks.

At the global level, 19 percent of carbon is locked up in plants, directly in the tissues,

The amazon basin is twenty percent of the worlds carbon.

Peat bogs store more than 250 GtC of carbon worldwide.

One can argue, the carbon cycle is entirely dependent upon the water cycle, without the cycling of water throughout the lithosphere, cryosphere and atmosphere, there could be no carbon cycle.

### Assess the relative importance of the roles of water and wind in shaping desert landscapes

One must demonstrate knowledge of water processes, exogenous, endogenous and ephemeral, the episodic role of water the temporal scale sheet flooding spatial scale channel flash flooding.

Wind: erosion, deflation and abrasion, transportation, suspension, saltation, surface creep and deposition

Some water landscapes are: wadis, bahadas, pediments, playas and inselbergs

Wind landscapes include: deflation hollows, desert reg pavements, ventifacts, yardangs, zeugens and barcadans seif dunes -> exemplify the role of wind in shaping desert landscapes


sources of energy in hot desert environments; solar insolation, winds] runoff, sediment sources, cells and budgets

these sources may be used to argue in favour of wind or water

geomorphological, weathering, mass movement, erosion, transportation and deposition, make links to the role of water/wind supporting these processes

wind abrasional processes shape and scour the land yardangs and zeugens are likely to appear

for deposition expect sand dune formation

### Desert 6 marker

Tree leaf foliage covewrage also reduces evaporatiom in shrubs pplants directly under, thereby reducing temperature

### Explain the concept of subclimate in succesion

Sub climax vegetation has not been able to mature to the natural climate vlimax vegetation for the region

This is because of arresting factors. The arresting factors is a local factor which has prevented the natural progression of the vegetation to climax.

There are many types of arresting factors some may argue that human inteference is an arresting factor, the palgioclimax is in effect the sub-climax community.

For example a managed upland moore is prevented from reaching maturity because of the human activity.

### With reference to a tropical rainforest evaluate the role of governance in environmental management

### 9 marker analyse the role of nutrient cycling within a hydrosphere or lithosphere

A ltihsosphere which is a sere originating in a rock, is a plant sucession that begins life on a newly exposed rock surfaced such as one left bare as a result of glacial retreat/tectonic uplift in the formation of a riaased beach or a volcanic explosion, such as the lava fields of eldgja with overtime saw lava solidify and nevome lithospheres

pioneer species are the first organisms that colonise an area of lithosphere  typicallr are very hardy such as xerophytes

in the case of a lithosphere the pioneer species create their own food/water as they ared autotrophic they do not require amnny external nutrition except sunlight

### Episodic role of watedr

The formation of wadis (dry river bed) bahadas (alluvial deposits), playas (dry lake beds), pediments (water eroded plains) inselbergs

The role of water in deserts also extends to a mechanical weathering  process diurnal temperature diurnal temperature is  more powerful when there is an presence of water that support the presenvce of exfolaiation

The role of water in desert vegetation evaporation outweighs water inputs leading to the formation of salt pans left on the plain

These salt lakes are highly saline with high concentration of soluble sodium salts onlt highly specialised halophyte vegetation ial exist evaporation of water has a direct bearing upon salt pan landscape, the role of water is also undermined historically

### The interrelatedness of carbon and water

However one could argue that there are many interrelateness in things such as photosynthesis

co2 + water this relies on the presemve for water and carbon dioxide for processes such as atranspiration

Furthermore when considering decomposition one must understand how it is undertaken by detrivores which cannot operate without the presence of water

Moreover, detrivores themselves respire which is a key carbon process which operates in the presence of water stored in soils and groundwater

In addition, carbon can be dissolved directly into large water bodies and carbon can be dissolved in precipitation when dissolved in water carbon dioxide reacts with water molecules, forming carbonic acid, which contributes to ocean acidity

Periglacial areas (cryosphere)  the process of decomposition are being exacerbated by climate change, the melting ice in the active layeris leadinf to rapid decomposition and a release of co2 and methane

Natual fires is a process releasing carbon dioxide and methane



Pryscience for example hrw maturation and release of seeds which is triggered in whole or iin part by fire or smoke fgire is a critical ingredient in the renewal of ecosystems or biospheres

one may argue from this that forest fires are not all bad, however of course this depends on the scale intensity and time duration

weatherinf is another process which releases carbon back to the atmosphere lithosphere orand hydroosphe,re requires the presence of water via precipitation or under sea water weathering

A final sophisticated response is that the carbon cycle is entirely dependent upon the water cycle for its existence, without the cycling of water through the lithosphere, cryosphere and atmosphere , there could be no carbon cycle,


### Outline the input of temperature variation in hot deserts

The main inputs in mechanical weathering the very high diurnal temperature variation causes rocks to break up due to the continued expansion/contraction plus or ten percent caused by the regular rhythmic
heating and cooling

it is the way high temperatures durind the day and the subsequent very low nightfall temperatures which causes the rock pressure

the very high temperatures also cause evaporaion of soil and ground moisture this contributes to a lack of soil formulation and vegetable growth leaving the area further vulnerable or open to meatherinf process very low temperatures freeze thaw weaathering

## Deforestation

In summation, deforestation causes the greatest impact on the Amazon rainforest - in the short term, allowing more rainwater to reach the ground, reducing evapotranspiration, whereas a long-term look sees climate change likely to have the ggreatest impact. It is predicted that rainfall amounts will become less in total and more variable. Climate change could in fact result in the decrease of the forest naturally, throuugh a drier climate so the two main causes are INTERRELATED

### The carbon budget

The carbon budget, is how much more carbon can be added to the atmosphere, that would hold the global average temperature at 2 degrees, above pre industrial levels amounted to approximately 800 billion tonnes of carbon. So far around 570 billion tonnes of extra carbon have been released, with temperatures currently approaching 1.5 celsius above pre industrial levels.


Radiative forcing, is the difference of incoming solar radiation, insolation, absorbed by the Earth and the energy radiated back into space.

Carbon dioxide is the single most important anthropogenic greenhouse gas GHG in the atmosphere, contributing sixty-five percent of the radiative forcing

Rising levels of carbon dioxide and other GHGs in post-industrial are fuellinf fears of climate change through climate change through atmospheric warming, atmospheric carbon dioxide approached one hundred fifty percent of the pre-industrial levels in 2021, mainly due to emissions from fossil-fuel combustion and cement production (caused by the production of clinker, the key constituent of cement)

At current rates of emissions, around ten billion tonnes of  carbon a year, there are about 25 years until what remains of the above carbon budget, above 230 billion tonnes, is released and the global average temperatures increases by 2 degrees celsius. To avoid dangerous climate change, substantial and sustained reductions in carbon dioxide emissions are needed.

One way of doing this is to leave most of the remaining fossil-fuel reserves in the ground and generate our energy in sustainable ways. Another is to remove some of the 'extra' carbon from the atmosphere. This could be done by managing forests and other land sinks to increase the amount of carbon they take up. There are also technoloogical solutions known as negative emissions technologies.

One example of this is bioenergy capture and storage (BECCS) if the carbon released by burning fossil fuels is captured before it is released back to the atmosphere, then electricity has been generated without increasing the amount of carbon in the atmosphere, then electricity has been generated without increasing the amount of carbon in the atmosphere or using up any of the carbon budget. However, BECCS is still at an early stage of development. Moreover, the carbon dioxide already in the atmosphere cannot be quickly removed, what ever technologies we deploy.


This means a certain amount of global warming is already 'locked in' the future will, inevitably, be hotter for the planet.

### Hydrographs

A storm hydrograph is a graph which shows theh response oof a river after a particular rainfall event

River discharge is the volume of water passing through a given point in a given point (cross sectional areas x velocity) cumecs

Labels include: discharge (Q) cumecs, time, peak discharge, peak rainfall, laag time, flashy, attentuated, rainfall event, rising limb, falling (descending+ limb, baseflow, bankfull discharge, flood

Basin size, is a permanent control on the storm hydrograph. Rivers with small basins are likely to have a flashier response to a rainfall event than rivers with a large basin whereas the hydrograaph for a large basin will be attentuated. This is because mater has less distance to travel to get to the gauging station in a small basin whereas in a large basin water may have to travel hundreds of miles before reaching the main channel.

Basin shape, rounder basins tributaries are the same distance, less distance to travel however this is reversed in elongated basins

Weather, antecedent rainfall,

Land usage, urban areas encourage water transfer, more impermeable tarmac increase surface runoff

Management, dams may hold back and store water, afforestation

Rock type, permeability how easily will  water flow through, porosity how many pore spaces. Porous rocks, e.g chalk hold water and slow... granite is more flashy, if soil is attenuated

Soil type, saturated soils result in rapid runoff,

Vegetation type, Decidious trees have few leaves so less

Drainage density, o lew drainage density leads to slower transfer

ANtecedent soil moisture conditions, if soil das reached its field capacity runoff will be greater

### Salt marshes

We don't know for certain why many areas of marsh vegetation suffer periodic die-back.

#### The formation of salt marshes

Salt marshes, occupy a mid level between the mudflats that edge the permanently submerged marine zone and the terrestrial (land based) haabitats that lie above the high water mark. Like sand dunes they result from the interaction of geoomorphological and ecological processes. The key to their formation is a low energy tidal environment, that is one where the sea's erosional ability is limited. This allows plant colinsation and sediment accumulation. THe plant community  then undergoes a series of changes known as succession. These combine to create a feature thaht can eventually emerge above sea level and become permanent.

#### Factors affecting salt marsh development

Salt marsh,

- Weather, stoorms can erode the marsh
- River regime, changes in currents and volumes can affect erosion
- Sediment supply, supply changes can enhance or diminish the available stilt
- Human action, commercial industrial and recreational activity can damage marsh
- Sea level, rises can upset equilibrium and destroy the marshes
- Climate, affects species types, growth rates and sea levels
- Wave type, changes in direction, nature and size can affect marsh stability
- Tidal regime, changes in tidal currents can increase erosion and alter species

During their lifetime, salt marshes have to adapt to changes in these factors, they try to maintain a balance between them, so they are said to be in a state of dynamic equillibrium.

The initial low energy environment can result from many causes. The most common causes are:
- the protection from the open sea provided in the inner reaches of estuaries and rias
- the protection offered by spits, bars or other coastal landforms


The latter is common. Indeed the formation of spits and salt marshes is often linked, as can be seen in places such as Hurst Castle Spit in the Western Solent. Once a low energy environment is established a number of processes take place to form a halosere or saltmarsh succession.

A succession is a vegetation sequence developed over time.

######## The formation of a saltmarsh succession

- As the tidal currents are slowed they begin to deposit material. This is fine grained at first. It may be encouraged by the growth off eelgrass in submerged areas.

- Eel grass helps slow the currents further

- Gradually uneven mud flats develop that are exposed at low tide

- These mud flats can then become colonised by pioneer plant species

- These plants are tolerant of salt and the periodic soaking of the sea caused by low tides. They are known as halophytes, they include species such as glasswort and sea blite. They are small and are annuals, new ones developing from seed each year.

- They gradually develop close vegetation over the mud. This allows colonisation by further types of plants such as sea aster marsh grass and sea lavender. These form a dense mat of vegetation up to fifteen centimetres high.

This vegetation creates friction to slow the tidal currents even further,  which causes more sediment to be deposited.

- Additionally, the vegetation itself traps particles. These accumulate eventually on the mud

	 The plants also produce leaves and stalks that die and help build the sediment level, This vegetation  waste or detritus can be up to 15 tonnes of dry matter per year

- These processes combine to increase the level ofthe mud flats by between one mm and thirty mm per year. They also provide a food supply for other species, such as small invertebrates to exploit.


As the mud levels rise, complex creek ssystems evolve that channel the flowing and ebbing tides. Thes become deeper as the land rises.

Eventually, the land rises above sea level as new species such as rushes and reeds become established . These species are perennials as are the trees s uch as alder and ash that appear.

By this time the salt marsh succession is completee This halosphere or succession also shows species zonation. Zonation can be defined as distinct spatial distribution. By this stage the upper levels of marsh are rarelly covered by the sea. Only hiigh spring tieds and storms allow them to become inundated.

Students frequently confuse zonation with succession in both salt marshes and sand dunes.

Salt marshes thus become attractive to farming and are often reclaimed. Many of the marshes around southern and eastern  England have been reclaimed and are being defended by sea walls. Today they are relict feawtures and are no longer beinf actively formed. Traditionally, they have been used for cattle oro sheep to graze but some have been draivned and "uimproved" and support arable crops.

Because of rising sea levels, some reclaimed  salt marshes are under theat and as the land is comparitively low value they have now been declared as areas for managed natural retreat. These coastal management strategies wil allow the marine erosion to breach sea defences to recreate the salt marshes as actinf as a natural buffer against future erosion.

ALthough the succession described has taken pylace over hundreds of years in the nineteenth century a new element appeared particularly in southern England. Cordgrass or spartina maritttime existed in england prior to eighteen hundred but increasing trade led to the accidental importation of similar species from abroade These interbred with the native forms to create a new variety called spartina anglica. This is an astonishing plant, perfectly adapted to survive in thte hostile conditions of tidal environments. It has
- glands to secrete salt and minimise dehydration
- deeply recessed pores to reduce water loss
- two root systews - a fine mat of surface roots to bind the mud and long, thick and deep roots with airways that can secure it in up to two metres of sloppy mud

It thus a remarkable ability to thrive  on mudflats. It grows so quickly that it can trap ut to four thoussand tonnes of silt/hectare/year. Not surprisingly a ready export market has been found for it. It has been used for reclamation purposes as a catalyst in countries as far apart as China and France.

Since the nineteen fifties spartina has been in decline possibly due to soil pollition. Salt marshes shave high levels og primarry productivity

threats to the salt marshes indusstrial polliton, euthrophciation, dredging remove sediment that maap allow scour and erosion grazing


### Feedback

Where the effects of an action are nullified by subsequent knock-on effects, such as an increase in the level of co2 concentration in the atmosphere may result in increased plant/fauna growth and therefore an increased uptake of carbon dioxide for photosynthesis decreasinf co2 in the atmosphere

#### Cascading systems

Made up of a chain of open systems where the output of one system forms the input to another


#### Water balance

The water balance is the difference between the inputs precipitation and outputs channel runoff discharge plus evapotranspiration

#### The drainage basin system

The balance of water ini the drainage basin can be seen in its water budget, the water budget is calculated through the formula
P = R + ET + Î”S

P - prrecipitation
e - evapotranspiration
delta - change in storage in soil or bedrock

The interaction between run-off, evapotranspiration and storage is in constant changthroughout the years and  depends on both the characteristics  of the pphysical ennvvironnment and climate

During the  dry season there is a soil moisture deficit caused by evapotranspiiration exceeding precipitation, when precipitation exceeds potential evapotranspiration there is soil moisture recharge, which can lead to soil moisture surplus, at this point the field capacity (the maximum amount of maisture that soil can retain) is reached. This will lead to changes in storage and increased throughflow and ground water flow,


### River Tweed (The Eddleston Water Project)

Historically, the early nineteenth century saw the river's course extensively altered and long sections were straightened.

The EMP, carried out the following on 17 seperate farms:

- 66 hectares of riparian woodland created which will help increase rainfall interception, evapotranspiration, soil infiltration and also slow overland flow

- 16,000 metres of fencing and over 70,000 native trees planted

- 1.8km of river re-meandered, this has increased river length, reducing the slope and speed of water flow and provided more space for flood waters, as well as creating new habitats and improving the landscape

- 89 'high flow restrictors' installed that will encourage out of bank flow  and hold back water in the headwaters

- 19 leaky ponds were created, 7000 square metres, these wetland features have a good deal of 'free board' built in so that they will store water during intense rainfall events

Runoff from agriculture is being closely monitoreed, farmers are not permitted to allow fertiliser runoff, salmon fishing contributes 24 million to the local economy,


80% of the catchment is used for agriculture, hill sheep,  cattle

However, soil compaction porosity,

After WW2 forestry comission began planting large scale conifer plantation,

10% of properties at flooding risk, wetlands protected to provide greater storage within DB system, upland trees are planted to increase rates of interception, dredging of larger channels saw the removal of sediment, which in turn increased the channel capacity allowing water to be quickly moved out of the system, Soft engineering in the form of boulders and woody debris left in the upper catchment slow water in upper streams away from human habitation.

Additionally, remeandering of straightened channels, floodbank removal slowed the flow of surface wate by harnessing natural capacity of the landscape to retain water, reducing flood peaks making flood events more manageable


Three main causes of rainfall in UK basins are frontal rain (pressure systems) e.g. atlantic depressions, orographic relief, convectional rain e.g. summer thunderstorms

Flow restrictors encourage out-of-bank flow, thus 'slowing the flow' typically of 'engineered log jams' or 'large woody debris', these instream structures are typically formed from locally derived timber and are deployed in a number of different ways, in the eddlseston catchment there are 40 flow restrictors in place.

Remember:

- Vegetation provides interception store (leaves/branches)
- Water intercepted is evaporated back into the atmosphere
- Water from leaves to ground falls by throughfall
- Water from stems/trunks is stemflow
- Water soaks into soils by infiltration, this movement of water is controlled by gravity, capillary action and soil porosity which is controlled by texture structure and organic content. Coarser soils have larger pores and fissures that allow for larger water flow. Burrowing of worms and insects with the penetration of plant roots can increase soil channels,
- As soil moistens, clay particles absorb water causing them to expand, reducing the size of soil pores, then raindrop impact breaks large soil clumps into smaller partictles such that said particles begin to clog soil surface pores, reducing movement of water into the soil.
- If rainfall intensity is greater than infiltration rate, soil reaches infiltration capacity very quickly, meaning the soil is saturated, water will build on surfaces as surface storage, such as puddles, wher surface stores are full then overland flow and sheet flow will begin on slopes.
- They will fastly rapidly reach next channels,

- Lateral movement of soil water downslope is called throughflow, more vegetated an areaa is the faster the throughflow is aided by root channels in the soil
- Percolation, infiltration water moves vertically down soil and unsaturated rock, which is then held as groundwater,

Throughflow, evaporation, infiltration, overland flow, interception, groundwater, soil moisture storage, groundwater flow, channel catch, transpiration , channel storage, surface storage, stemflowO

Initially rivers are fed by throughflow of soil water and groundwater, slow movement means discharges are small

As storm water enters drainage basin, rivers are fed by fast moving water

The more circulare a drainage basin is, the flashier it is, due to it being equidistant

- Steeper sides, influence of gravity is stronger
- If there is high drainage density, the hydrograph will be flashier

- If there was antecedent rainfall, overland flow increases , the infiltration capacity is reached and lag time is reduced

- If surfaces are baked from dry weather, the impermeableness increases flashiness as...

- Vegetation cover, deforestation reduces interception rates, erodes soil, leads to sedimentation depositon and suspension of channel, reduces bankfall capacity of river, greater chance of flooding

- Ploughing breaks up topsoil

- Before deforestation overland flow is minimal

- Groundwater is stored in aquifers which are layers of permeable rock or soil that can hold water, the water table is the level at which the soil and rocks in an area are saturated with water. When groundwater is abstracted or pumped out of the ground it lowers the water table, this can have several negative effects on the hydrology of the area, one effect from over abstraction is that it can lead to a reduction in the amount of water available for surface water sources such as rivers  and streams. This can make the flow of these waterways more variable, with periodss of low flow during dry s pells and higher flow during wet spells, In turn, this can increase the risk of floodingn during periods of heavy rainfall, as the capacity of the rivers and streams to hold and convey water is reduced.

Another effect of over-abstraction is that it can lead to subsidence or sinking of the ground surface. When water is pumped out of the ground, soils and rock can collapse  in on themselves as they dry out, leading to subsidence. This can create low areas in the landscape, which can be more prone to flooding during periods of heavy rainfall.

Overall, over-abstraction can have a significant impact on the water table, which in turn can increase the risk of flooding in a drainage basin.



If water abstraction in ever coming up remember the aral ea in uzbekistan

Soil moisture is that which is held together with  air in unsaturated upper weathered layers on the earth

Soil moisture is a key  variable in controlling the exchange of water and heat energy between land surface and atmosphere


### Water balance

Biological water will constitute  the water stored in all the biomass storage of water providinng a rrfsorvvoir of water that helps maintain climatiic environmments if vegetation is lost then climates become desert like, in some cases 95 percent of plant weight

condensation is the direct cause of all forms of precipitation

If air temperature is reduced to dew point warm moist air passes over cold  surfaces volume of air increases but there is no addition of heat (adiabatic cooling) air rises and expands in the lower

Pressure in the upper atmosphere, air is forced to rise over hills (orgraphic rainfall) masses of air of different temperatures and densities meet, (less dense warm air rises over denser cold air) (frontal effect), localized warm surface heat air above, which expands becoming less dense and rises (convectional effect)


Superimposed on current trend

Why does sulphuric acid reflect the sun and cool the earth.

The cement industry produces fifteen percent of global anthropogenic emissions, calcium carbonate is heated producing carbon dioxide. Cities are responsible for 49 percent of global carbon emissions.

### Ecosystems

Thirty percent of carbon dioxide is carbonic oceanic acid, increasing the oceans acidity, which leads to coral reef loss, as the pH of water decreases its corrosiveness to shells and skeletons also increases

Ocean warming of symbiotic algae, which need coral to grow, leads to bleaching and eventual death of reefs

Arctic sea ice retreated fourty percent, highly reflective ice replaced by more heat absorbent water, when it starts to melt, ocean can absorb more sunlight, rather than reflect, in turn this amplifies warming, and ice melts - less albedo effect

### Hot deserts and landscapes

Inputs, solar energy, precipitation and wind, erosional processes, components are erosional and depositional landforms and landscapes, aeolian/fluvial transport, outputs are sediment removal, clear skies allow energy to radiate back to space

The cycle of desertification

Desertification -> decreased agricultural and livestock yields -> local populations increase livestock numbers and extend and intensify cultivation ->deforestation and overgrazing occur -> soil quality is degraded and reduced vegetation leaves soils exposed to erosion by water and wind

Hot deserts receive less than 250mm per year

The aridity index is the ratio between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration

Deserts climates are characterised by external extremes, temperatures vary wildly annually and diurnally, very low humidity, low cloud levels enable clear skies with high solar insoration, diurnal ranges over thirty degrees

As distannce from the tropics increase, so does annual temperature range due to increased seasonality of the climate


Desert margins have variations in temperatures, those on poleward sides of arid areas are significantly colder than those on the equatorial side

Deserts closer to the sea, such as atacama have cooler less extreme temperatures than continevn tal ihteriors - this may be relevant in literally any desert essay

Cloudbursts can deliver total annual rainfall in hours

### Soils

Soils are infertile with thin soil profiles, limited organic material for nutrient build up

thick accumulation of mineral salts, capilliary action, moisture moves upwards when evaporation exceeds precipiitation

Main zonal soil type is aridisols, infertal alkaline

### Vegetation

net primary productivity ranges from 0 to 120,
succulent xerophytes have cells in fleshy leaves where they store water

they are adapted, to rapidly absorb water immediately after rainfall since water doesnt penetrate deep into the soil

Tey have shallow extensive wide roots, saguaro roots extend 10m, thick waxy cuticles and closed stomatas, making themm waterproof, spiky leaves to reduce surface area to limit trannspiration

Ephemerals are dormant during dry spells, they have short life cycles, blooming after rainfalls, producing seats

Halophytes saltbush tolerant salinity

#### Causes

Global atmospheric circulation, lattitudes are 20 to 30 degrees north and south of the equator

dominated by high pressure, equator net gain in energy solar insolation, directly overhead with high anngle of incidence

Air heated rises then cools causing vapour to condense, tcloud formation and precipitation

-> rising air replaced by air rusihing in from north and
south creating low pressure ITCZ. Rising air begins to cool poleward , now at
20-30 N/S, cool denser air descends, warming and expands, little cloud formation
->
- Causes clear skies
-
- Continentality


#### Continentality

With a low specific  heat capacity land heats up more quickly and to a higher temperature, but then cools rapidly at niight

Then , inland no  clouds to block insolation - extreme high daytime temperatures but large diurnal range

Coastal areas receive higher amounts of precipitation

High levels of evaporation - water vapour and latent heat taken into the atmosphere

Water heats up more slowly and to a cooler temperrature than land with its hige specific heat capacity and heat is transferred at death

Less moisture needed for cloud formation, sahara can be over 2000km from nearest sea

Relief
On the leeward side of mountains, there is a rain shadow effect
Only the windward side will experience relief rainfall and cloud formation as the moist air is brought inland by prevailing winds. Over the summit air descends sinking air warms leading to less relative humidity and clear skies due to lack of humidity, therefore less precipitation


Cold ocean current - wind moving over cold waters  is cooled causing relative humidity to increase , moisture is condensed to create fog and mist offshore, land heats up quicker than the sea, lower specific heat capacity, this generates gentle onshore breezes which takes fog and mist inland, yet the intense solar insolation from overhead sun with high angle of incidence burns this away.

The twelve hours of daylight, from the high angle of incidence means that for every given amount of radiation is concentrated, a smaller area of earth than at higher latituhdes, draw this in exams how at ninety degrees the equator is but at ten degrees it is more spead ou

Due to the lack of vegetation in desert floors, exposed ground does have low specific heat capacity

### Wind

Wind is an agent of erosion and transportation, lack of barriers such as vegetation

runoff from spotty rainfall is spatially localised, and temporral rare intense storms however can cause rapid overland flow, runoff, transporting sediment only  to be exacerbated by baked ground and limited vegetation

### Sediment

Derived  from weathering of underlying parent material or material fluvial in origin, past rivers may bring sediment to deserts. If ephemeral sediment mty be left on river beds episodic rainfall can deposit sediment. Sediment can also be originating from beyond desert marrgins as aeolian loess. ultimately there can be a net sediment loss or gain

##### Weathering

Weathering is the breakdown of material in situ, this produces regolith

##### Mass movement

Movement of material downhill, influenced by gravity/rainfall. Which is dominated by by rock falls and slides, collapses en masse

##### Erosion

Involves the removal of denunded surface material , erosion results in the degredation of surfaces

##### Transportation

Traction, large stones are rolled along the channel bed by movement of water downstream, requires high levels of initial energy and discharge

Saltation, bounced along the channel bed, requires both discharge and energy to be high enough to lift then drop particles, dislodging other particles, which repeats the bouncing action.

Suspension, smallest particles are carried by the flow of water, the turbulence of moving water carries it downstream

Solution transports dissolved materials

Deposition, load can be left behind from water when it evaporates

##### Weathering

Thermal fracture leads to rapid heating and cooling of rocks , this leads to a regular rhythm of heating and cooling, freeze thaw weathering, congelifraction, dislodging, ice expannds by 9 percent

Exfoliation, the breaking splitting of outer rock layers, onion skin

Chemical weathering, water once present, evaporates dissolved slats are deposited , they grow in size, crrystals, there are different thermal capacities, which leads to the expansion and contraction breaking down rocks

Hydration, depends on continentality, morning dew causes rocks to swell

##### Wind

Relatively barren deserts have few organic materials to create friction, winds can blow unimpeded for considerable distances

Deflation, wind removes dry, unconsolidated sand , which leaves a desert pavement/reg as it removes only the finest material

Abrasion has a sandblasting effect, it has a sandblasting effect then hits the exposed rock surrface, although this is highly dependent on direction, frequency, velocity, lithology of rocks , which could have been affected fluvially, hoow large said carried particles are is also dependent on the strength of the wind. More importantly the very origin of said carried particles may be fluvially transported originally

Wind itself, creates deflation hollows, such as the qattara depression, it reaches 134m below sea level, although to argue in favour of waters dominance, the depth of the deflation hollows themselves are controlled by underlying groundwater

##### Transportation

Suspension through wind, is called the 'red rain'

Saltation, wind bounces particles, causing a dislodging effect

There is also surface creep hit the larger particles that are too heavy, crawling among from the push of saltating grain and the movement of wind.

As the wind velocity decreases, there is deposition, of loess

Deposition may also occur if wind meets an obstacle, forming dunes, the obstacles may also be formed fluvially

######## Water

Rivers and sudden isolated heavy downpoours, ephemeral rivers

That flow on the surface, appearing intermittently after heavy rainstorms.

This is exacerbated by the scale of precipitation events itself, the lack of existing vegetation which means little interception occurs, the removal of loose surface by aeolian processes, the desert is baked hard, soo torrential nature of rainfall exceeds the infiltration capacity itse

####### Episodic

The episodic nture of rainfall in hot deserts regons is exempified well in north africa. Subtropical deserts like the sahara remainh arid most of the time due to the dominance of high pressure conditions, giving average rainfall  of 25 mm/year generally and only rising to 100mm in certain high plateaus. In fact parts of Western Algeria and southwest Egypt can go anywhere between two and five years without receiving more than 0.1 mm of rain in any 24 hour period. Yet single rainfall events can deliver two to three times the annual average in short intense desert storms. Some west-facing slopes in parts of Algeria have recorded intensities of between 8.7mm in 3 minutes and 46mm in just over an hour.

Disruption of high pressure cells along the sub tropical high pressure belt can lead to trouoghs or gapps in the high pressure at the surface allowing more moist air to move north and create low pressure areas and rainfall on the southern edges of the Sahara. In desert areas where there are local water sources to provide moisture for the atmosphere, if conditions are favourable, the intense heating of the desert surface can lead to localised warming and rising of air and localised low pressure systems developing. With such intense heating and rapid rising and cooling of the air, large releases of latent heat during condensation can fuel uplift creating large but short lived thunder storms

Sheet flooding occurs, but as this happens theere is sheet wash in which rain dislodges and movesurface material, as the volume of water increases - overland flow will intensify, erosional features are created from sheet flood, but also depositional features - downstream - 

If this overland flow is funnelled into steep sided valleys, known as wadis, then channel flashing can occur

#### Aeolian landforms

Ventifacts are exposed rocks, that are abraded by wind-blown sediment, such as sand - likened to a sand blasting effect - best characterised by multiple smoothed facets, prevaling wind changes direction over time?

Yardangs, are streamlined parallel ridges of rock (they look like the upturned keel of a boat), alligned in direction of wind, abrasion does smoothen the ridge, it is now thought agents such as deflation
and sporadic fluvial incision have played a role

Zeugen, is a collective term for rock pedestals , mushrooms with considerable undercutting, abrasion is the main cause of this, hard resistant layers are eroded last, which causes the discrepancy in abrason

Sand dunes are depositional landforms they require

- Ready supply of sand
- Prevailing winds that are not strong enough to remove more than is deposited
- Obstacles such as vegetation/rock (past fluvial action)


#### Water landforms

Wadis, are steep sided wide bottomed gorge like valleys formed by fluvial erosion

Bajadas and pediments are gently sloping areas of rock and debris, fluvial erosion, alongside depostion to material washed down, as the capacity and competence of water is reduced, deposited loads form alluvial fans as distributaries, alluvial fans wilil beginn to coalesce forming bajadas,

Playas form when ephemeral streams flow into inland basins, the water quickly evaporates due to the intense overland heat and high angle of incidence which leaves behind a dry lakebed, consisting of salts.

Inselbergs...

Some landscapes will have features that record a much more fluvial past, the dominance of wadis can indicate it was far wetter historically


#### Desertification

Climate change, sees higher temperatures, increased evaporation and reduced condensation, that will in turn see less rainfall (total amounts and reliability) inicreased drought (frequensity and intensity), eventually rivers and water holes dry up, and there is less rainfall, this means vegetation dries, and there is a decrease in the PROTECTIVE vegetation cover


Change in farming, increases in livestock numbers, this leads to overgrazing, soil becomes depleted of nutrients and the land is stripped of its protective grass cover, vegetation cannot re-establish itself, soil exposed to wind and rain

Population growth, high birth rates, refugees from civil wars and droughts, This forces farmers to change from traditional methods of land use as more land is needed for food crops (grass ploughed up), increased demand foor wood to cook heat and build. AS vegetation is removed there is an increased risk of soil erosion.

All of the above points ultimately lead to DESERTIFICATION



In the last 25 years the Sahel has had the greatest loss of rainfall anywhere on the planet, without available moisture from precipitation, evapotranspiration is limited, often the only local water source, reduced water supply as rivers start to dry up and the water table falls, evaporation exceeds precipitation

Even if human efforts are carried out to reverse the effects of desertification, vegetation cannot be easily reastablished  due to soil erosion from wind and sheet erosion, there contiunes to be an increased demand for fuelwood, which contributes to deforestation, link this back to how population growth continues the cycle, 

Twelve million hectares of land are being lost to desertification annualy 

Globalisation might increase cooperation and resource transfers to desertifying areas, the zai man singlehandedly later with extended support reversed desertificiation on a local scale

#### Succession

Autotrophs are plants manufacturing their own food, consumers are dependent on producers for food.
Primary consumers are herbivores, secondary consumers are primary carnivores, such as foxes and snakes. Tertiary consumers are lions and wolves, quaternary consumers are not eaten  by any other animal such as lions and tigers

Decomposers are bacteria and fungi, breaking down the dead organic material

### Succession itself

The gradual process by which ecosystems change. 

Primary succession is the series of community changes in an entirely new habitat thats never been colonised before

Secondary succesion is the series of community changes on a disturbed habitat, for example a fire

Primary succession develops by gradual colonisation of a lifeless abiotic surface, entire sequence of a stage is called a sere, the stages are referred to as seral stages, each new stage

- Contains more biomas
- Has more species
- Has greater net primary productivity
- Has greater net flows of nutrients and energy
- Structurally more complex

The end product of succession is the climatic climax community, the time required is unrealistically long, external disturbances and environmental change means its unlikely to happen

If in the development of an ecosystem, succesion can be halted by an arresting factor, this cat occur suddenly or gradually and can have a permanent/temporary effect, sub-climax community

Topoclimax - change in topography, deposition of mud
Hydroclimax - change in drainage, water table raised
Biotic climax - introduction of an alien species
Plagioclimax - environment maintained by management, forest clearance?

Will remain as long as the human activity continues, will revert to its original path, unless a permanent change occurs

A 1.6 degree increase in temperature puts 20 - 30 percent of species at risk, this superimposes the current trend


#### Hydrosere

Deep freshwater has micro-organisms and plankton floating. Sediment begins to be deposited which decreases the water depth.

Eventually allows for roooted submerged plants such as pondweed, 
as plant life starts to grow, organic matter sinks more and more to the bottom, 
vegetation and roots can trap and hold more of the incoming sediment,
such that the water becomes shallower, 
decomposing dead plants provide food for detrivores, 
this increases the nutrient amount in water,
which in turn promotes plant growth,
Emergent plants then grow, and the marsh floor progressively rises

Indicator species can indicate biodiversity , stonefly nymphs indicate oxygenated water
Species richness, refers to a number of different species
Proxy measure for other aspects of biodiversity, most practical unit of management

##### Ecosystem services

Provisioning surfaces, supply of food/water
Regulating services, climate, water storage and purification
Supporting services, soil formation and nutrient cycling
Cultural services, recreational and spiritual

### Deep sea cold water corall reefs

Polyps and coralline algae absorb calcium carbonate from water to build hard skeletons
Coral animals, polyps are colonial (incompletely seperated) and the dead structures house them
Coral polyps are filter feeders they use tentacles to trap plankton and small fish
Symbiotic, zooxanthellae grow inside corals
Algae receive shelter/nutrients, in return pollyps share sugar , that algae create through photosynthesis
Coral filter feed, while algae zoo photosynthesise
Coral need certain levels of sunlight, turbidity from cyclones
Highly sensitive but survived numerous mass extinction events
Colonies of small clear bodied polyps who have a symbiotic relationship with zoo which live inside their tissues, algae give coral their colour

Coral reefs are home to one third of all marine species, coral reef fish provide stock for twenty five percent of fisheries in tropical locations, produces thirty six million in tourism, higher ocean temperatures reduce calcification abilites, ocean acidification increases erosion of bleached coral skeletons, they dissolve faster in acidic water

The damage impacts the structural complexity of coral reefs, when coral tissues dies the underlying carbonate skeletons are exposed,  when coral tissues die the underlying carbonate skeletons are exposed and subject to erosion via:

Physicial disturbance from cyclones, chemical erosions by dissolution, and bio-erosion as parrot fish bite of coral chunks. macroalgae-dominant state, when fleshy macroalgae grow over weakened carbon skeletons flatter coral reefs

Ability of reefs to dissipate wave energy and provide coastal protection declines, reduces fishery productivity and revenue
A fifty percent decline in reef structural complexity will double amount of wave energy reaching tropical shorelines, there is a positve feedback mechanism, reduced shoreline protection causes further erosion


##### Tropical coral reefs

They thrive in temperatures of 23-29 degrees optimal for photosynthesising zoo, they denature, a one degree rise can cause coral bleaching, the paris agreement is not ambitious enough

Heres a major failure of cop26, "Consign coal to history" . the outlook report

Sea level rises, sedimentation leads to the smothering of coral,

Changes in storm patterns, more frequent storms, reefs tossed

Changes in precipitation, increased runoff freshwater and pollutants

Algal blooms, cause murky waters, this turbidity makes it difficult for photosynthesis and

ALtered ocean currents change in temperature regimes and connectivity, lack of food and dispersal of larvae
 a
Ocean acidification, means there is more carbon dioxide, a reduction in pH levels, decreases growth rate and structural integrity

Assaturation drops coral, finds it harder to calcify and exposed skeletons can dissolve

El nino warming of ocean water in pacific, can be enough to kill of coral permanently, 

Ultimately the recovery period decreases as global warming intensifies

Increased eutrophication algal growth, encourages crown of thorns starfish which feeds on corals

Found between 30N and S of the equator, where surface water temps do not drop below 15 degrees, these reefs can grow up to 100cm a year

Calcium carbonate is absorbed from water by colonies of coral polyps and coraline algae, underlying foundation are layers of coral skeletons, living reef is built over the top of this by tiny coral polyps adding new limestone to the structure

Coral polyps have small symbiotic algae or zoo inside them, this algae gets shelter and food from nutrients from captured plankton from the polyp, so the polyp captures plankton for them

And the polyp gets food from the algae via photosynthesis

If the euphotic zone suffers from high turbidity and there is too much sediment there is a threat

When a coral bleaches it loses its zoo and will die in weeks unless it is replaced, superimposed on the current trend

#### Impact on over fishing for the future of the coral reefs

Fish and sea urchins graze on algae, this keeps space clear on the seafloor for new corals to grow and settle, these coral reefs create three dimensional space and provide food and shelter. 

However, the absence of fish and urchins result in an abundant growth of algae, which outcompetes with coral polyps for space on the seafloor, which results in less habitat for fish and urchins.

#### Real life examples

In 2005, sea surface temperatures were high and on average 34 percent of Jamaican corals bleached. In places thhis rose to 95 percent. Fortunately, less than half (13) percent suffered subsequent mortality.

Coral reefs develop best where the salinity of the sea water is between 34 and 37 parts per 1000. Where rivers flow into the sea there are gaps in the reef because of the lowering of the salinity locally. 

However, studies regarding links between the acidification of sea water and coral development have been inconclusive. 

The formationn of calcium carbonate produces carbon dioxide, well fed corals respire more co2 than their symbiotic algae, which makes water around them naturally more acidic, therefore its difficult to assess how important acidity is

Bauxite mining, deposits large amounts of sediment, coastal hostels and excess nutrients from fertiliser lead to eutrophication, causing algal bloomss - unwanted chemicals are flushed out to sea

More than 450 million people live close to corall reefs, relying on them as a source of tourist revenue.

People rely on them as buffers that dampen the energy of incoming storms, further increases in dissolved ocean co2 make waters more acidic, depleting carbonate ions that the coral needs.

In 2012, ecologist Roger Bradbury provided a bleak outcome in an opinion piece for The New York Times, saying 'There is no hope of saving the global coral reef'

However, growing evidence suggests that coral reefs can better aclimatise to shocks and disruption in the long-run

### Biomes

The dark shrub layer is ideal for decomposition

There is little twilight, each day has twelve hours of sunlight, there are no seasons hot and wet all year round. There is a low diurnal range of temperatures.

Tropical rainforests are found where tradewinds from NE and SE come together in the intertropical convergence zone, at these low lattitudes intense solar energy from overhead sun inducts convection and rising air that lases its moisture through frequent rainstorms, over 2000mm rainfall each year.

Each canopy tree transpires 760 litres of water anually, net primary productivity is 2200gm.

Rainforest soils are called latosols, which can be more than 40m deep, the red colour is because of iron minerals, theere is a moisture surplus, in a process of leaching, iron is less soluble and left behind, while other minerals are leached.

Leaves have drip tips and waxy surfaces allowing rainfall to be shed, discouraging bacteria and fungi

### Reasons for forest clearance

In many tropical countries, majority of deforestation results from the actions of  poor subsistence cultivators. Shifted cultivators is a term used to describe these small scale farmers and their families who find themselves squeezed out of traditional farmlands in areas far outside the forests. They migrate to the last unoccupied lands available. They generally have little understanding of the ecological workings of tropical forests and so they practice unsustainable forms of exploitation. The best estimate of numbers is somewhere between 200 million and 600 million and satelite surveys inidicate that they account for roughly two thirds of deforestation. They represt one of the biggest human migrations ever in a short span of time.

Virtully all forest cleaninig is done by fire, though thesefires are intended to burn only limited areas they frequently escape agricultural plots and pastures and char pristine rainforest especially in dry years like 2005

A large portion of deforestation can also be attributed to commercial exploitatiion of forest resources. Timber, such as mahogany from Brazil and teak from Myanmar, has been removed in an unsustainable and illegal manner.

There are a small number of large landowners that clear vast sections of the Amazon rainforest for cattle pasture to feed the worlds increasing demand for cheap beef, large tracts of forest are cleared and sometimes replaced with grasses.


Favourable taxation policies combined with government subsidised agricultures and colinisation programs have encouraged the destruction of  the amazon rainforest.

Despoliation.

Low taxes overvalue agiculture ard pasture and  make it profitable to convert natural forces for these purposes when oterwise it would not be so.

Brazil is one of the worlds top producers and exporters of sugar cane , soya beans , oranges and other products. In the nine states of the Brazillian Amazon, the area under intense mechanised agriculture grew bymore than 3.6 million hectares from 2001 to 2004
The greatest increase in area planted to soya beans was in Mato Grosso Â£Â£Âthe brazillian state with the highest deforestation rate (40 percent of new deforestation
Brazillian scientists have developed new strains of soya beans that flourish in the rainforest this is a worrying impetus into expanding soya cultivation, soya farms push ranchers and even subsistance farmers even deeper into the forest. They are a key economic and political impetus for new highways encouraging deforestation even more

Amazonian vegetation protects latosols from heavy tropical downpours once trees are removed the .topsoil is exposed to erosion and leaching of nutrients and minerals, runoff causes sediment to block river channels increasing flooding and this causes even more sheet flooding and this leads to more sedimentation
The microclimate is disrupted by deforestation the daily water cycle of rapid evapotranspiration, less cloud cover so greater temperature range occurs, leads to drought and agricultural failure
Kuala Lumpur experienced smog over 3000km, forests ability to naturally sequester carbon 

THere are fifty million people living in the rainforest, as soil becomes less fertile, new areas are cleared and old ones are abandoned and without human maintenance may become eroded

### Benefits of Amazonian burning

Burning releases minerals locked up in vegetation and produces a layer of nutrient ash material above poor topsoil, this supports vigorous growth, however this usually is quickly depleted to support the growth of commercial soya, Palm oil is found in fifty percent of packaged foods, cattle ranching causes eighty percent of deforestation


Palm oil is found in fifty percent of packaged foods, cattle ranching causes eighty percent of deforestation,

However, changing attitudes have meant that timber firms are coming to see unharmed woodland as an asset that propely managed, can yield a good income forever. Studies have shown that sustainable management ofo forests, also known as reduced impact logginig (RIL), can be more profitable than the conventional methods of timber extraction. One such study conducter near Paragominas found that RIL was twelve percent cheaper than conventional logging.

IN RIL schemes, the area to be exploited is divided into up to thirty blocks, one of which has timber extracted each year, before being left alone for twenty nine years. This is enough for the foorest to regenerate successfully, becaause in addition to rotation, the scemes take care to leave the oldest speciments of the exploited species standing. As ell as providing cover from the tropical sun, the spreading branches of these tall trees re-seed the block with new specimens. RIL reduces the damage further  by plotting the position of each blocks valuable trees on a computer, which then works out the shortest set of access roads, that need to be carved out to remove the felled trees. Lumberjacks are also taught ways of felling trees that avoid damaging those around them.

# Plagioclimax and heather

Communities determined by anthropogenic activity are deflected towards a different climax community as opposed to their full climatic climax, arresting factors include burning, grazing and trampling

## Heather moorland

Forests were removed in the middle ages, sheep grazing prevented the regrowth of woodland, any new saplings were destroyed.

Yet, heather is a hardy shurb able to survive as less competition from other species, swaling is controlled

There is rotational burning at cool temperatures, which allows new shoots to grow from existing rootstock below surfaces, this doesnt kill heather but only shocks the seeds into germinating quickly, asd from burning adds to the soil fertility helping young growth, essentially burning maintains the plagioclimax

Moorland association members pay 52.5 million a year to manange moor, there is a postive multiplier, grouse are fully recovered, with a local multiplier effect, heather is comprised of small evergreen leaves which contain resin, helps reduce water loss from evapotranspiration, fungi in roots help break down organic matter for absorption

### Savana

The despoliation of the Amazon rainforest has been driven by a combination of factors, including logging, mining and agriculture which have all contributed to the destruction of one of the worlds most valuable ecosystems.

The impetus for sustainable development practices have grown in recent years, as the consequences of environmental degradation become increasingly clear. With deforestation, over-extraction and other forms of exploitation threatening the health of the planet, there is a growing urgency to find solutions that balance economic growth with environmental protection.

#### Serengeti

With each foreign visitor they bring in revenue, what is the cutoff point. how many visitors is too many, Migratory patters and breeding seasons are affected? 

Local landowners use wired fencing, which forces wildebeest to retreat into protected zones, searching for more grazable grass.

Infrequency of rain due to climate change complicates planning, migration and breeding seasons

If biodiversity decreases then there are less feaces returned to the soil, less elephanats means less uprooting of trees, less decomposition, rivet redundancy theory

Homogenisation of species, means rise in competition for other vegetables

Local tribes increased demand for fuel woods/fertile lands, they become pushed into new margins, despoliation of more lands

Locals scare away elephants with firecrackers

Wired fencing in wildlife management areas can cause wildlife to migrate into non suitable parts.

Tragedy of the commons plus appropriation of revenue, commercial farming excludes wildebeast from wet season range

Mildebeast is a keystone species, they remove dry grass, which means there is less cover for wildfire to spread, fire means less growth of new young species for the next season of wildlife

Moreover, if the population of wildebeast decreases, lions may start attacking cattle, masai poison lions as retaliation

Overgrazing depletes soil of nutrients, reduces fallow time ,land reusesd before regeneration, disruptive arresting factor, pastoralissts leave fertile footprints

However if the population of cattle is small and localised, manure can fertilise "glades" of lush carpets, cattle should also be rotated, so area has time to regrow

ICTZ dictates wet and dry seasons move south in january and north in july, wet growth period, soil recharge

Growing seasons less significant because of irrigation system, water diversion

If evaporation increases, the salinity of soils increase, duricrusts, the water table is lowered, what happejns if acacia cannot tap roots

Cryptic plummage birds with dense feathers camoflauge, dense plummage also keeps birds warm

Feeding niches exploit unique vegetation

# Heather

Alleopathy - Heather itselg, produces chemical compounds which stop the growth of competition

Seratony - adapted to produce seeds in whcih , these seeds only open when exposed to fire, enables to take advantage of burning, nutrients

### Storm hydrographs

Vegetation intcerpets precipitation and adds to rates of evapotranspiration

It is increasingly common in winter for the frequency of floods to increase because trees and other vegetation lose their leaves , therefore what season it currently is highly dependent on the severity of flooding, this can be used to argue against the amount humans play in flooding.

Rock type is also important, permeable rocks like chalk may absorb water, while impermeable rocks may encourage greater amounts of surface runoff.

Drainage density, the higher the drainage density results in increased risk of flooding as there are more tributaries and streams.

Urbanisation is another factor, impermeable surfaces like concrete and tarmac increase surface runoff as well as the drainage sysems which help the water reach the river quicker , decreasing the lag time.

# Desert systems

Hadley cell causes dry air, rain shadow effect itcz coupled with hige angle of incidence , continentality air overseas moist, deep in land air becomes moist

Ventifacts are exposed lying rocks which are abraded by wind blowing sediment, sand blastihg potentially fluvial in origin, multiple smoothed faces by prevailing wind

Yardang are streamlined parallel ridges , their streamlined shape suggests that aelian process is dominant

However presence of many yardangs will take many years millions, deflation sporadiic fluvial incision may have played a role 

Maram grass holds sand dunes together it has huge nodule roots so if wind blows it will further bury the maram grass, rotting of rock 


# Carbon

Biological pump - carbon transferred from ocean surface to deep ocean, 

Phytoplankton live near surface , they use carbon dioxide from the atmospheric store to photosynthesise and create organic matter, these die to ocean floor, carrying carbon in their bio store, deep in ocean phytoplankton are responsible for removing ten to twenty percent of carbon each year

# Ecosystems under stress

TRF

Gatot Irianto - 'stop demonising palm oil' , 'gift from nature' 'helping to eradicate poverty' miles of hectares razed, emplofs indirectly

Yet Costa Rica bucked the trend in nineteen fourty five, sevety five percent of the country forest, was helped to be replanted,

WWF mililons of hectares of trf hazve been razed

Surprisingly Brazil and Indonesia are the third and fourth largest emitters of greenhouse gas, one da'ys burning of rainforest equivalent to eight million atlantic flight passengers

Huge carbon sinks, but fragile disappearing fast, carbon within rainforest stored in trees, soils are thin litter layer, fast nutrient cycling does not enable soil store to develop 

Once a forest reaches primary status it can sequestor for centures, later succesional stages have higher biodiversity lack of human interference allows for ecological niches to flourish naturally creating endemic species forming complex symbiotic species interaction

Biodiversitiy

Rivet theory, rivets represent species more species lost the weaker ecosystems become, and more vulnerable. Redundancy, theory some species are more important than others, keystone species, cascading effect

# Climate and soil

Hot 30 degree temperatures during the day, high rainfall of 2000mm year round, High evapotranspiration rates due to high temperature and low pressure, low nutrient soils rapid nutrient cycle becauses the high rainfall means a moisture surplus accumulates therefore high levels of leaching take place, microclimate at shrub layer only receives two percent of light

TRY thirty percent of net primary prohuction, and covers only seventeen percent of earths surface

## Soils

Wet, anaerobic soils in mangrove swamps are carbon stores, decomposition of organic matter is slow so carbon remains intact and locked, bacteria and microbes detrivores are unable to survive , so little carbon is respired back into the atmosphere, wetlands are crucial sequestors of carbon ,r rathor than carbon capture same applies to tundra soils

# Lithosphere

Stage 1 (Pioneer species)

Primary succession, first species such as lichens and mosses, are autotrophs to colonize bare surfaces, fungal hyphae bind lichens to rock. the death of mosses and lichens adds organic matter, gradual accumulation, inblown dust, and weathered material create the first protosoil, ,makes future colonisation easier, lichens secrete acids, weathering rock releases minerals, lack of competition, enables pioneer species to increase rapidly, however they add humus when they die, mosses add moisture available for seeds of their plants, thisi enables colonisation of a greater range of plants

Then seeds are able to germinate in surface cracks, where moisture is. The population of detrivores increase and the amount of organic matter increases, earthworms drag fallen leaves below surface and convert them into fertiliser
Moreover, earthworms burrow aerating the soil, increasing the ability for plants to uptake oxygen, 

the presence of earthworms attract birds, who through their faeces desperse seeds, taller grass species eventually emerge once the layer of stuff is tall enough such as japanese knotweed

Climatic factors that limit growth include cloud cover, relief rainfall, orographic rainfall and atlantic moisture

Some soils simply lack in nutrients because the parent rock is resistant to erios, high precipitation also leads to leaching of nutrients or the rock is composed of acidic materialse

Main arresting factors which prevent saplings recolonizing is animals grazing

Over time the soil hue to wetter climate becomes more acidic

The peat store is a large carbon  store in the UK

### Weathering

Biological weathering, with detrivores excreting faeces, mechanical disentegration returns  minerals.

The clearing of reed beds is necessary in order to enablee a hydrosere to regenerate with each of its hydrosere phases, the drought of 2020, meant woodberry woodlands experienced abnormal temperatures, the increasing frequency of such extreme events, superimposed the current trend

 
Woodberry Wetlands 
Area of urban wetland, nature reserve site, spanning 11 hectares at east reservoir.  
Reedbeds are adapted flora â€“ dominating, with hollow stems that tolerate fluctuation in water level, 
resistant to drought, withsta d persistent soil mositure budget, host small insects within the stem

The pelagic zone, is too deep for establisehd rooted plants, waterlillies with stomata colonise. In the 
lioral zone, which his nutrient rich, waterloggfed, reedbeds dominate, they can survive rainfall being 
high.j they flourished in 2023 when woodberry wetland faced lenthy wet season. Brown earth soils, oa 
trees.  
The reservoir was biologically dead until the 1990s, as a result of chlorine ggas cleaning water, human 
intervention were introduced by reedbeds, planting of 13000m2 of new reedbed via use of dredged 
sediment enabled its establishment, ecosystem engineers. Hedgrewors birds, japanese knotweed

Cryosphere change acts as a buffer minimizing changes. It is a natural store of frozen solid, 
some principal changes are lithospheres, weathering and disintegration. 
 
First organism to return are called pioneer species  
SERENGETI 
Multi ethnic area, maasai pure pastoralists, other tribes agropastoraliss need crop cultivation. 
One problem is that, tribes need to burn grass to ensure better growth of young grass next season for 
cattle grazing, such burning makes succession impossible. Their place is taken byherbaceous and woody 
resistant plants. Thorny animal repellant trees become numerous, acacia. 
However faeces, are pastoralists leave fertile footprints, biodivesity m uch higher in those area.  
 
 
The intergovernmental panel on climate change says a 1.6 average puts 20 â€“ 30 percent of species at 
risk. 
 
Coral reef 
Composed of calcium carbonate, or limestone, absorbed from water by colonies of coral polyps and 
coralline algae. Underlying foundation of reef is dead, made from layers of coral skeletons. Living reef

### Ecosystems under stress continued

By 2010 hackney borough council was receiving vast sums of regeneration capital and some of it was
directed towards the housing at the edges of the reservoir, and a little bit of overlapw ith your human
geography here. Hackney council for a number of years used the strategy missâ€™ thatcher wanted to use
for a number of years she invited tenders from a number of major housing developers to regereneate
refurbish housing in that part of the city.
Revise walthamstow woodlands
Japanese knotweed smothers people
The purposes of woodberry
Amenity
Wellbeing
Biodiversity
And also regeneration
Now theres strategy was incredibly simply they say to the developers in this case barcly homes you cn
have these 3 tower blocks for a pound. Next to nothing so long as you develop them, yes,
And a share of the profit that you are gonna make in selling them of you give to the council to refurbish
the other tower blocks.
So the councils more or less saying we havent got any money, well let you do it and sell them of to
people on higher incoems but a big chunk of the money youre making from literally gentrifying this area
you have to give to the council who will spend this on upgrading the properties.
Some call this planning gain and it gains money to ugrade the inferior homes, yes some people just call it
corruption barcly homes get the opportunity to demolish and build homes for people on much ihgher
incomes who make a heck of a lot of money who give the council a bung, and the council can spend this
on whaterver it likes depends on whaterver your interpretation of whatever is going on is
Barcly homes in conjunction with thames water and the environemtal agency have been responsjble for
yupgrading the entire area which is now known as woodbury down, 2016 critical year in which it was

Think Global. Act Local.
It is pertinent for stakeholders I.e. National Park owners, governments etc to consider and recognize
that there will be global consequences, for example the Amazon Rainforest primarily due to Brazilian
policy is no longer the worldâ€™s largest carbon sink. As opposed to the mentality of thinking locally, such
as only considering the benefits deforestation and logging has to the local community, for example
generation of jobs and greater revenue. Acting locally, involves action which includes this global 
mentality, local communities are considered to the extent that it will not have negative repercussions on
a global scale, I.e., putting a cap on the amount of deforestation taking place.
Assess the effectiveness of the management of a local ecosystem you have studied?
Assess the implications of this data for sustainability in areas of savanna grassland in east africa. Using
figure 12 shows a range of issues facing game parks and reserves in kenya east africa.
Data:
Tourism has beneficial impacts on the Serengetiâ€™s sustainability by large yearly visitor profits *150
million, which may be used to fund upkeep and conservation of the Serengeti. Figure 12 shows that the
ratio of foreign visitors to Kenyan visitors is 14:11, the greater presence of foreigners may have a
favorable economic impact since international tourists may be higher spenders on guided
tours/packages. On the other hand, their larger presence may be regressive towards the Serengetiâ€™s
sustainability, as they may be less attentive to their littler and nose pollution, which may alter migratory
patterns (stressing animals) and pollution. Revenues peaked in 2018, with 150 million and since 2015,
there has been year on year growth of 21%, with current trends suggesting this figure will only grow as
indicated by the constant rising limb. However, to counter-evaluate an extremely small percentile of this
figure filters down through to the local stakeholders, the indigenous tribes which maintain large
proportions of the land. In 2018 53% of tourist earnings went to large TNCâ€™s who manage tourism and
with 35% going to the central Tanzanian government, meanwhile a potentially negligible figure went of
12% went to local people. Less funds directed to local landowners perhaps suggests in the future as
tourist numbers rise, they will be unable to treat issues such as tourist pollution and natural increases in
animal population. However, it can conversely be argued since stakeholders such as TNC and
government have a larger share in revenues, their self-interests will also be towards the sustainability of
the Serengeti, as the sustainability of it, will provide a constant income-source.
Within the figure we see that since 1977 cattle and sheep populations have increased around 1100%
since 1977. This has seen herders and agriculture farmers be pushed closer to the Western border of the
savanna ecosystem. This has for example, seen wildebeest retreat into more protected zones as they
look for more grassland to graze. From 1977 to 1977 wildebeest populations in the Masai Mara fell from
around 119,000 to 22,000. This is as a result of the wildebeest in the Serengeti and Masai Mara Game
Reserve being mostly migratory in their patterns. As the land they can migrate around has fallen this has
lead to overgrazing causing the land to be less able to sustain their populations. However, within the
Serengeti there is a core protected area in which no farming or poaching is allowed. This provides
habitat for the wildebeest. However, this core protected area is relatively small compared to the
previous area wildebeest used to have to migrate around â€“ thus meaning it can only support a fraction
of the previous wildebeest population. Efforts creating larger buffer zones between the core protected
area have helped to minorly reduce the encroachment but does not appear to have had significant
impacts. In the long-term the large population growth within the Serengeti and Masai Mara regions is 
likely to put greater pressures on farmers to illegally graze land further reducing the sustainability game
reserves in Kenya.
Tourist earnings cannot directly tackle larger problems such as global climate change. Global
temperatures increase by 1 degree each year and in the long run this may exacerbate ongoing
droughts/lead to out-of-control wildfires. The largest threat is rain pattern, the growing natural
population of both livestock and wildlife threatens migratory patterns, breeding seasons.
On balance as climate change in the Serengeti becomes more prominent, longer and more intense
droughts will become common, followed by periods of flooding thanks to excessive rain. Tourist
earnings cannot directly tackle such larger problems, global temperatures increasing by 1 degree each
year may exacerbate ongoing droughts and wildfires. Moreover, such disruptive rainfall may disrupt
migratory patterns and breeding seasons.
