## Chips and Science Act

USA, backed by more than 100 billion USD, in government grants, loans and guarantees for semiconductor firms to build factories in USA.
Unleashed further significant amound of investment in US-based electronic chip production.
This all follows significant investment in renewables due to the Inflation Reduction Act.

China is also building up to 30 new facilities for part of this important supply chain.
China still controls this key manufacturing sector.

While China is the largest supplier of such chips, it is also an important revenue source for US, Japanese and especially European companies that supply the motor vehicle industry there.
China is the world's biggest market for electric vehicles, which need growingnumber of chips for sensors, power management and braking systems - and it relies on foreign chipmakers like Infineon of Germany and Texas Instruments (US) to meet that demand. 

China outpaces othecs in chip capacity buildout despite sanctions.

## European migration to the UK post Brexit

Since 1 January 2021, EU nationals arriving in the UK must follow one of the specified visa routes for residence in the UK.
Dueu to post-Brexit immigration policy, only 5% of all visas post-2021 have been granted to EU nationals. 
EU citizens make up more than holf of those refused entry at the UK border.

New enrolments of EU students have drastically fallen by 53% (2021/22) negatively affecting UK universities. 

Today EU students without settled status:

must enter the UK with a passport and a valid study visa.

are not entitled to apply for a student loan in England or apply for free university education in Scotland.

are not able to bring dependents while studying.

are required to pay in advance the immigration health surcharge (£1,035 for each year of the visa).

Such restrictions do not apply to Irish students.

Although immigration of EU citizens to the UK fell sharply after 2016, most EU migrants already here did not leave the UK. Most EU-born migrants in the UK today come from central and eastern Europe, with the top countries of origin being Poland, Romania, Ireland, Germany, Italy, Lithuania, Spain, Portugal, France, and Bulgaria.

Problems remain in protecting the rights of EU citizens who are eligible to stay or have been granted settled or pre-settled status under the EU Settlement Scheme.

These include:

bringing family members to the UK.

longer waiting times at the UK border while immigration status checks are being carried out.

issues over entitlement to UK welfare benefits for EU nationals (or their family members) who have pre-settled status.

issues over entitlement to British citizenship for EU nationals or their UK-born children, which is dependent on acquiring settled status.

Those coming here to work are mostly young and economically active, though as these EU migrants age, access to healthcare and to information about state pensions becomes more relevant to them. Coastal and rural communities have a larger percentage of older EU migrants, many with employment in agri-foods or hospitality, in places such as King’s Lynn, Boston and Wisbech.

Implications for the future
Despite the reduction in EU migration numbers post-Brexit, and the significant increases in non-EU migration (over 600,000 last year), key economic sectors of hospitality, agriculture, logistics (lorry driving), nursing and social care face major labour shortages. British-based investment in training and education is unlikely to improve the preparedness of the local population to undertake these types of work that migrants are historically more willing to do.

It is inevitable that immigration will be required for the UK economy to grow – even the Conservative Chancellor of the Exchequer, Jeremy Hunt, has acknowledged this, though many of his political colleagues refuse to accept this. Questions remain about how this is to be achieved sustainably and also guarantee the protection of students’ and workers’ rights.

Major political challenges remain, which appear to be increasingly anti-immigrant.
