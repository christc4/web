# Interdependence

Interdependence is one of the key concepts of an A level Geography course that can be applied across several elements of the subject. It refers to the degree to which different natural elements, places, environments, themes, concepts, and systems are both interconnected and mutually dependent.

In physical geography, within ecosystems, the Gershmel model illustrates how the three main components of an ecosystem, the soil, the biomass, and plant litter, are all mutually dependent upon each other. Healthy soil requires inputs of nutrients returned from the biomass via the litter store. Vegetation and soil are each dependent on the other for their health and survival. The model also illustrates well how aspects of carbon cycling operate within an ecosystem.

The concept of interdependence can also be applied to global systems within human geography. Here, there are four dimensions of interdependency which are commonly recognised: economic, social, political and environmental.

Economic interdependence:

·         The growth of TNCs has stimulated cross-border exchanges of money and merchandise – marketing is now done on a global scale, and thousands of products are recognized and bought around the world

·         Flows of migrant workers are now essential for the economic success of many countries. In return, migrants send home remittances to the source country, in some cases being among their largest individual sources of GDP revenue (e.g. Bangladesh and Tajikistan)

·         Many countries are no longer self-sufficient in vital commodities such as food, energy, or water, leading to widespread mutual reliance between countries. The Ukraine war has illustrated the strength of interdependence that the world had for oil and gas from Russia, and for grains and sunflower oil from Ukraine. For water, see my earlier Substack on the GERD dam in Ethiopia.

Political interdependence:

·         The growth of trading blocs (e.g. the EU and USMCA – the trade deal between the US, Canada and Mexico previously known as NAFTA) has created complex international and global governance structures which countries co-create and are legally bound by

·         Some governments depend on one another for support in times of economic or political crisis, again as illustrated by the response of the West to the Ukraine war

·         At a global level, the World Bank, IMF and WTO work internationally to harmonise national economies, with varying levels of success and support.

Social interdependence:

·         Migration builds family networks across national borders - this can strengthen relationships between countries (e.g. India and the UK)

·         Migrants also contribute to the systems of host countries e.g. the large numbers of overseas workers within the NHS

·         Social interconnectivity has grown over time due to the growth and spread of mobile phones and digital money transfers.

Environmental interdependence:

·         Nations cooperate on global environmental threats such as climate change, ocean plastic pollution and biodiversity loss because all countries appreciate the value of these ‘global commons’, including Antarctica

·         Global agreements and treaties can only work if a critical mass of countries sign up - all states depend on others to build a consensus (e.g. the Paris Agreement and subsequent deals on climate change).

Contested opinions.

Interdependency can be a problematic concept. Some people view that the global economy is a single functioning system composed of many interdependent parts and players. This statement may imply that the global economy is a mutually beneficial structure which everyone is happy to be part of.

However, it has been reported that the world’s eight richest billionaires, e.g. Jeff Bezos, the former owner of Amazon - all of whom are men - collectively own the same wealth as the planet’s 3.6 billion poorest people. Some people on the right of politics regard globalisation as a bad thing - something which has led to a globalist view of the world, with sinister views of control over people against their will, and leading to, amongst other things, mass migration around the world. Deglobalisation has also led to the notion of ‘taking back control’ and the growth of nationalism.

Have human systems built on interdependent relationships led to outcomes that are extremely unfair? Should we think critically about the link between interdependency and (in)equality.

Why do interdependent geographical relationships generate controversy?

This is probably because of the complexity of the relationships that have been established. In global systems, vast interconnected supply chains have developed over time, with positive feedback loops amplifying both gains and losses of jobs in different places. As a result, it is hard to quantify the net impacts of, for example, trade blocs. The changes associated with trade agreements are happening at the same time as other changes, including rapid technological innovation, political decisions, and expansions in trade. The current arguments regarding the economic interdependence of the USA and China illustrate the complexity of their trade relationships. The TikTok controversy is just one small part - a Chinese tech company operating widely within the US, used by millions of young Americans, and yet frowned upon by both state and congressional leaders. Some people are keen to ban the social media giant in the UK.

Different people may decide to factor in these other variables in their deliberations, or not — perhaps because of their own political views on interdependency and what they hope to create. The ongoing Brexit debate within the UK, several years after the ‘vote to leave’, illustrates the degree to which political views impact attitudes to interdependence.
