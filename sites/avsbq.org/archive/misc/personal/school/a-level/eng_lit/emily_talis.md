In Chapter 12 of Atonement, McEwan presents Emily Tallis (E.Tallis) as a maternal figure who completely
misreads the criminal. Initially, E.Tallis considers Marshall as a suitor for Cecelia, posing the rhetorical
question “was he suitable?”. Indeed, E.Tallis appears more concerned with his physical appearance, “the
pity about his looks” is fore mount in her thoughts, rather than being concerned with his apathetic
attitude towards Lola’s bruises. Moreover, she is concerned about the “riches” he can attain if “Amo
bars” becomes successful. In terms of intertextuality, one could argue that her relationship with Paul is
reminiscent with Catherine Morlands relationship with Tilney in “northanger abbey”, both women are
initally drawn towards charming and wealthy men. Indeed this could suggest that McEwan purports this
pervading idea of larger commentary on the dangers of judging people solely based on their sufracelevel qualities, which enables criminals such as Marshall to avoid being accused of crimes due to his
qualities.
Secondly, McEwan presents E.Tallis as a dismissive figure. She claims “nothing good will come out of”
Robbie graduating from Cambridge, E.Tallis precisely embodies ideas against the levelling up of lower
classes, the expressionless statement encapsulates her dismissive attitude. She even views her husband
paying for the tuition fees of Robbie as “meddling”, which can be inferred to suggest that she believes
the lower classes should be left to themselves, without interference, contrary to the ideas of noblesse
oblige.
Finally, it can be argued that E.Tallis is trapped by societal expectations, E.Tallis shares a similar trope
with Catherine Morland. Trapped by societal expectations, it can be inferred she lives in a loveless
marriage, she “doesn’t wish to know why Jack spent so many consecutive nights in London”, which
suggests that she possesses no interest into his personal affairs.
