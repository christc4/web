# The Great Gatsby

Gatsby initially believed in the American Dream
He hails from a "shapeless and shiftless farm people"  to which he becomes a "wealthy socialite" who holds extravagant parties with "champagne". Imitates "Dan Cody", working for free to get a "headstart" in life, doesn't get hisi inheritance.  GGatsby became prey under the guise a possible reward it wasn't possible for Gatsby to level himself up a class. Changes the suffix oof his own name, to become more WASPY, anglicises himself, remoured relation tot hte "Kaiser", indeed after ww1 prejudice against Germans was rife, Gatsby works for free, abandons his identity of a farmingg yokel and eventually resorts to crime

Gatsby is the architect of his

## Key context:
- Published in 1925
	- Cannot overstate how Fitzgerald's work is mortifying for an American readership
	- Their so-called 'American Dream' literally unravels before them

- Casts readers minds to America's earlier spouts of optimism
	- 19th century 'Gold rush'

- Fitzgerald himself was a partaker of the decadence and hedonism he wrote about
	- Thus possesing an acute awareness of '20s social climate

- Written against backdrop of the 'roaring 20's' - America's economic boom

## Observations:

Demystifying Gatsby, leaves readers with a complex character with a checkered history. His meteoric rise to infamy perhaps breathes life into Fitzgerald's' readership - fueling the American dream.

Fitzgerald highlights how some enter life handicapped or with a silver spoon. Yet even with this boiled down approach of the text, some are born in the middle - in a state of limbo. Like the novel's women, who possess inate intrinsic value; through their beauty. One's dream is another's nightmare. Any analysiss of Wilson, Daisy and Myrtle reveals how Gatsby and Tom are jointly tone-deaf to their plight. Indeed, Fitzgerald subtly pits old and new money against each  other, all the while spotlighting how Gatsby's mind is thoroughly in the pits of romantic hell.

Utterly enamored and enraptured by Daisy, Gatsby seems almost pathetic. Yet, also heroic nearing the novel's tail end, himself volunteering to take the fall for Daisy's reckless driving. His unwavering desire of a woman in wedlock is his death-wish. Perhaps, knowing there exists an infinitesimally small chance of his dream coming to fruition. Gatsby, pursues anyways - destroying his life and the lives of others around him. A farcry form how one should be experiencing their 'American Dream - He wasn't the guidestone of the 'roaring '20s' Nick hyped him up to be.

Yet, this myopic r eading of the text where everyone is hyper-invested in Gatsby skirts away from the crux of the text. Who doesn't love a 'rags to riches' story. While yes, Gatsby reveals a great deal of the male-psyche. The novel highlights the working-class hellscape, 'Valley of Ashes'. Spoual and male-on-female violence. The list continues, until this homegrown ideology of the 'American dream' is proven to be theoretical and ultimately shatters alongside the eponymous figure Gatsby.

Gatsby gets no honourable send-off yet is awarded by Nick with the epithet 'Great'.

## Quotes, motifs and obscure obbservations

Dust motif:

- "Her life violently extinguished&hellip; mingled her thick dark blood with dust"
	- Epitomizes a figurative and physical reclamation of the Valley of Ashes, he lifeforce (blood) fuses with dust that is a metonymy for the Valley of Ashes.
	- Ultimately, Myrtle was not able to escape the Valley of Ashes, despite being the mistress of Tom Buchanan
