Othello, preparation before exam,
Make sure to include more of the story 

Does Shakespeare build upon the fear of female subordination

- Iago - He [Othello] as loving his own pride/purpose
- I fetch my life/being from men of royal siege my parts,title and perfect soul shall manifest me rightly
  - Fate is challenged, tricolon captures spiritual nobleness and his status back home
- My ancient, a man of honesty and trust. Honest Iago
  - Ironic epiphet, appearance vs reality
- Fair Warrior (from Des.), Dear Othello, Souls joy
  - Prescribes a millitary tone
- Tis a soldiers life to have his balmy slumbers walked with strife
  - The inevitability of it all, lives defined by strife, whims of fate, the passing phrase captures the inseperability of private and public
- Let her speak of me before her father
- My blood begins my safer guides to rule
  - Othell's violence is his compass
- Tis the plague of great ones, tis destiny unshunnable like death, forked plague is fated to us
  - No one is immune to tragedy
- Think my wife be honest. Think not
  - Mounting evidence hard to ignore
- Whip me ye devils roast me in sulphur
	- Calls for divine retribution and eternal damntation
- I will kill thee and love thee after, lest she betray more men
- Essentially a honour killing
- Cuckold me! The justice of it!
- Are we turned Turk, for Christian shame!
	- Exonerates Christian value
- Let her live damn, her minx
- This fellow’s of exceeding honesty,
And knows all qualities with a learnèd spirit

Desdemona:

- His unkindness may defeat my life, but never taint my love
- Why gnaw thy nether lip
- Thy solicitor shall rather die, than give thy cause away
- My hearts subdued, hitherto your daughter, here's my husband
- Beshrew me, wrong for whole world
- All but stomachs, we are food, hungerly they eat, when full belch us
	- Women are disposable, existing only to satiate men
- Who wouldn't make their husband a cuckold to make him a monarch

Brabantio:

- Look to your houses, daughters, bags, abused, stolen and corrupted (Iago)
	- This tricolon groups the three, evoking a sense of transaction, parallelism suggests status is monetary
- For if such actions have passage free, bondslaves and pagans our statesmen shall be
	- Threatens societal cohesian, natural order
- To scan this thing no further. Leave it to time.
