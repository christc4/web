To what extent has Angela Carter’s Bloody Chamber provided solutions for the
feminist movement?
There is indeed debate as to whether Angela Carter’s 1979 work, The Bloody
Chamber, has provided solutions for the challenges second-wave feminism sought
to tackle such as patriarchy and domestic violence. One side of the argument
draws attention to short stories such as “The Bloody Chamber” which through the
creation of a strong female character points women towards seeking autonomy
and rejecting oppression, contrary to patriarchal values. On the contrary, it can be
argued Carter merely documents and replicates extreme forms of
patriarchy/domestic violence yet fails to provide solutions for second wave
feminism. A final interpretation that will be explored is whether “The Snow Child”
uses strong violent imagery. This essay will investigate all three possible readings
of the text and evaluate which is most significant.
Upon first reading, it is obvious that Carter intends for readers to picture the
mother character of “The Bloody Chamber” as a figure of strength. Readers first
hear of her as “indomitable”. The superlative adjective identifies her as a
character who cannot be exploited which perhaps foreshadows that the Marquis
could not exert his power over her. This reading is reiterated shortly afterwards
where readers hear that the mother: “shot a man-eating tiger, nursed a [plaguevisited] village and outfaced a junkful of pirates”. These accomplishments not only
present themselves as the mother embodying masculine traits, unusual for
women of the time, but highlight how traditional famine traits, such as nurturing,
can also be upheld through the courage and indefatigability she exhibits. A
feminist reading of this may suggest Carter is deconstructing patriarchal attitudes
towards women of her time. Indeed, Carter was concerned with “a balance of
scales [between men and women]” as suggested by Margaret Atwood. Thus, it
can be suggested Carter’s creation of a strong female character provides a
solution for second-wave feminism as she suggests female readers must
showcase both masculine and feminine traits, in light of the mother’s
accomplishments, for society to treat women as equals rather than the notion
they must be docile and submissive. This notion manifests itself in the narrator
herself, as her “mother’s spirit [drives her] on” and that she “[inherits] nerves and 
wills” while opening the Iron Maiden. The abstract nouns “spirit, nerves and will”
create a semantic field of determination encouraging the narrator to be
unphased. This can be interpreted to suggest Carter deliberately employs
empowering imagery through the mother character to inspire women to be brave
and courageous in the face of oppression, as demonstrated by the narrator who
ventures into the torture room despite its many horrors. Furthermore, the notion
that the mother is the short story’s figure of strength is accentuated; the narrator
turns to her mother for a means of escape, “Assistance. My mother” instead of a
traditional male character. Carter literally replaces the original brother character,
in Bluebeard, with a strong mother not only solidifying the strength of women in
her novels but ultimately implying that women should be autonomous and
strong. The mother then rides to her daughter's aid and “without a moment's
hesitation” the mother shoots the Marquis. This can be read symbolically to imply
the liberation of women in patriarchy. Furthermore, writer Jeanette Winterson
argues that “Carter was trying to lift women out of the many myths that they’d
been placed [in]… and that we should write other kind of stories about women”.
Carter’s creation of the mother character supports this in every way, dispelling
myths prevalent in the 1970s of women being; submissive, powerless and unable
to be independent. However, it must also be said that this interpretation employs
violence towards oppressors, as the mother commits murder, the interpretation
cannot be fully extended to suggest women must dispose of their oppressors
through brutal acts of murder yet instead embody the traits of strength the
mother possesses.
Yet, a more plausible interpretation argues that while “The Bloody Chamber”
provides some solutions for second-wave feminism. A larger challenge, ownership
and status, are only documented and fundamentally unchallenged in “The Snow
Child”. As first suggested by Madelana Gomez, Carter is “complicit with male
dominance” as she pushes male ownership to the figurative extreme through the
Count’s ability to summon a “child of his desire” and the title of characters. This
represents the infantilization of young women and perhaps the short time frame
in which the girl is summoned suggest that men with status such as the Count are
easily able to fulfill their sexual desires. This is indeed problematic as the short
story offers no practical solution for women facing similar challenges yet can be
argued that female readers are being taught fear. The story proceeds with the 
transferal of clothes, the countess becomes “bare as a bone” and the girl “furred
and booted”. Indeed, as Patrick Duncker suggests this “merely recapitulates
patriarchal patterns of behavior” as the story takes a dark turn exploring themes
of necrophilia and rape. The phallocentric imagery of the Count “thrusting a virile
member into the dead girl” takes place all without intervention from his wife who
only watches “narrowly” suggesting she finds the act distasteful but due to lack of
empathy is uninterested in stopping the act. The story features no emotional
connection between the two women, the Wife demands the girl fetch her brooch
in icy water, to cause her death. This is indeed problematic as it suggests that
women are unable to recognize each other’s predicament both women in the
story are reduced by the Count’s status, yet the Wife has no empathy for the girl
yet “hate[s] her” suggesting she believes the girl will displace her status furthering
the notion that she has no emotional attachment to the girl. . The story only
spans two pages and features no resolution for the deceased girl or punishment
of the Count suggesting Carter only spotlights extreme male fantasies. Although,
the story can be read to suggest just as many real-life cases of the challenges
women face from male sexual violence are met without justice; Carter merely
reproduces a scenario in literary form. Despite, the lack of solutions Carter
highlights a wider problem to readers and how silence or lack of involvement as
demonstrated by the Count’s wife only further enables men of status and power
to exploit young women.
Yet, a closer reading of “The Snow Child” suggests Carter is merely using hyperexaggeration of domestic violence to draw light to real world challenges that
second-wave feminism fought against such as domestic violence. Adjectives such
as “dead” can be interpreted to suggest, defenselessness or that the trauma from
domestic violence I.e. rape, leaves women feeling as if they are figuratively dead.
Moreover, the lack of emotional interaction between the two women may also be
Carter implying that women who benefit from the current patriarchal system,
such as the Wife, should not continue to be oblivious to the exploitation of
women beneath them in status. As this will continue to purport patriarchal and
damaging attitudes towards women, as demonstrated by the Count’s hypersexualization of the child. Therefore, this reading can be extended to suggest
Carter purposefully uses graphic imagery to draw attention to real world cases of
domestic violence. The notion that Carter merely documents the challenges faced 
by women becomes less plausible as Carter indeed displays the consequences of
extreme patriarchy; perhaps warning readers what would happen if society’s
views towards women did not shift. Furthermore, it can also be suggested Carter
expresses her personal views, that just as the wife is silent, most of the world
remains oblivious to the suffering of women, including women themselves.
Therefore, an additional solution is that both men and women should not be
bystanders to domestic abuse.
In conclusion, whilst The Bloody Chamber can be read as problematic through lack
of clarity and resolution in “The Snow Child; it cannot be denied that “The Bloody
Chamber” purports an encouraging view that women can be autonomous and
strong rivalling patriarchal views that women are submissive and weak. This
indeed provides a solution for second-wave feminism as it seeks to create an
equal playing field for both men and women, which did not exist in the 1970s.
Moreover, through “The Snow Child” Carter suggests the world must not remain
silent towards the domestic violence faced by women. Solutions are thus found in
two major forms: women becoming more autonomous/stronger and intervention
in domestic violence.
