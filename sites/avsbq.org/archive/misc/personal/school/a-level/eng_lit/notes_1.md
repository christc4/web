ambitions, however his intellect is his transgression, social strata.
Briony and the war becomed entwined into one oppressor
QUOTES:
171 - “It might not have been him” - challenges determinism, questions reliability of
memory and fallibility of human perception, highlights complexity of guilt/responsibility,
societal structures prevent Robbie from defending itself. Ultimately, circumstantial
evidence, shows weakness of her testimony
168 - “L was required only to remain silent about the truth, banish it and forget it

and historical forces
“That’s or cleaning ladies son” dismissive of identity, prescrpes mother occupation,
fopremount, class foremost to idenitty.

fingered for a lifetime”

Atonement Chapter 10 Quotes
Briony -
“She was entering an arena of adult emotion, from which her writing
was bound to benefit... savage thoughtless curiosity prompted her to
rip the letter”
- Typical of bildungsroman, letter used as crime evidence? Showcases
Briony’s childlike attitude towards the world about to be rocked as she
opens the letter.
“[Wrong to open letters] essential for [Briony] to know everything”
- Briony acts as a police figure, well before any involvement of the law.
Highlights, double standards? Briony commits a crime, to reveal what
she believes to be a crime?
“With the letter something elemental, brutal perhaps even criminal,
some principle of darkness, Excitement over the possibilities”.
- Briony convinces herself of what appears at face-value, reflects the
legal system of the time? It shows how she is getting ahead of herself,
through emotive language.
“A maniac, the word had refinement and the weight of medical
diagnosis. All these years she had known him and that was what he had
been”
- Briony is quick to ascribe a derogatory title, to a man she has
known almost all her life, misunderstandings define a victim
“Her immediate understanding was that she had interrupted an attack,
a hand-to-hand fight. The scene was so entirely a realization of her
worst fears”
- Confirms previous notions that Briony, convinces her mind of
what she visually sees, fails to consider events prior in her quick
judgement. Massive exaggeration of what took place highlights
how her childish mind creates a crime scene.
Cecelia -
“There was no sign in [her] of gratitude or relief”
- Confirms that no actual crime took place and justifies the notion
that Briony massively exaggerates events which had taken place.

RICHARD II
Gaunt uses his final breath to speak truth, he recognises the flattery
that is leading richard astray
Gaunt juxtaposes his wholesome council with r’s unstaid gauth, his
words expose the recklessness and immaturity of richards rule, youth
and vanity, richard has unkingly attributes
Shakespeare appeals to audience patriotism
Gaunt loves england however
Decadence profligacy
“within thy crown” SPATIAL metaphor
Landlord quote
Thou diest, though he the sicker be
Richard is unable to hear gaunts own warning
Richards hubris is his debasement the very thing that validates his
positioon in england
Gaunt loves england more than richard, polar opposite
“fortress, precious stone, blessed plot” whereas richard is a landlord
“leasing out this country” therefore, to an audience, shakespeare
appeals on audience patriotism, to portray richard as a bad man
Cecelia totally m isreads the crimi

Chapter 13 + 14 Homework
Christ Amlai
Setting:
Hot Weather encourages loose morals, builds tension in the dining room.
Robbie’s social upstart, dismissed as a mere “hobby”.
Page 171 - “It might not have been him”. Circumstantial evidence shows the weakness of
Briony’s testimony which is not picked up on.
Page 168 - “Lola was required only to remain silent about the truth, banish it and forget it
entirely". Lola, although a victim of pressure, is an accomplice in the false accusation presented
against Robbie. Highlights, her as a collateral victim of Briony’s crime.
Page 170 – Constantly alludes to the bildungsroman
“That’s our cleaning ladies' son”. Dismissive of Robbie’s own identity, prescribes his mother’s
occupation – class foremost to identity.
Lola looks to Briony to help her, yet Briony prompts her into lying. Whilst Paul Marshall remains
on the sidelines, being deceptively friendly to the police. Moreover, Paul Marshall provides
attention to a 15-year-old girl (compliments her trousers) receives compliment (for his shoes),
which allows him to overpower her, which she later will at every opportunity. Lola says in the
“same weak submissive voice, yes it was him” - she is prompted by Briony to give false
testimony. This highlights the prevailing theme of collateral victims (others on the sideline are
hurt). Chapter 14“Did he [Robbie] believe he could conceal his crime behind an apparent
kindness, behind the show of being the good shepherd” - misreads the victim, religious 
undertone, highlighting Robbie’s victimhood encompassing genuine kindness towards the boys.
“A rosary to be fingered for a lifetime”
“To seal the crime, frame it with the victim's curse, close his fate with the magic of naming.” -
pure DETERMINISM. “[Paul Marshall] seemed to send them on their way” - uses class to evade
law, punishment, accusation.
“Liars! Liars! [finally vanished into the whiteness” - shows how initial accusations can essentially
erase the classless from society
