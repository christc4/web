# Richard II

Richard's fatal error enables his peers to form negative opinions of him.

These same opinions culminate in his enemies conspiring against him. Richard appears beyond reproach several times in the play. Lapsing from hubris to self-pity. Such is the point, critics argue he luxuriates in his own grief, to the point his downfall seems absent.

Some textual scholars, argue Richard sees martyrhom in his deposition through his Christ-like imagery, i.e, "So as Judas did to Christ".

Richard is maladjusted to being Bolingbrokes subject, after he has been deposed. 
Having been raised as the child King, it was only natural for him to subscribe to the 'divine right of Kings'. It cannot be overstated how mortifying it would be for an Elizabethan audience to see Richard plume-plucked.

> Plume-plucked means to be stripped and humiliated.

This idea of humiliating Richard persits in the notion of a 'public coronation'.

Richard's mirror scene reflects him searching for his new identity.

Richard is 'bankrupt' of his majesty, Shakespeare uses economic diction. Richard is forced to say amen, which evokes pathos for Richard, as this is an uncomfortable truth for him to swall, this debasement adds to his humiliation.

Shakespeare foregrounds Richards youth.

Carlise, "What subject can give sentence on a King" predicts disorder. Richard is a figure of God's majesty, captain steward, deputy "Heinous black obscene"

Bulingbroke "Foul traitor"

Carlise foregrounds the chaotic situation to come.

Ricards iconic monologue,

> My Crown I am; but still my griefs are mine;
You may my glories and my state depose,
but not my griefs; still am I king of those.

"The ripest fruit first falls" Richard the young king

"Nobles are fled, commons are call" Richard has no support and even struggles to bolster support through the commoners, who BB has affinity towards

BB is the perfect foil, while he has Northumberland, Ross and Willoughby as allies Richard has bushy, bagot and green, the "caterpillars of the commonwealth" which can be developed to argue Richard has poor company

This only goes to show BB has a kingly judgement of character

Let's purge this choler without letting blood

Now put it, God, in the physician's mind, To help him to his X immediately! The lining of his coffers shall make coats to deck our soldiers for these Irish wars.

We are inforced to X our royal realm.

Not all water in the X? rough rude sea can wash the balm from an annointed king.

THe breath of worldly X cannot depose the deputy elected by the Lord.

With mine own tears I wash away my X
With mine own hands I give away my X
With mine own tongue I deny my sacred X
With mine own breath release all duty's' rites;

Let them hence away,
From Richard's' night to Bolingbrokes fair X

For God's sake, let us sit upon the ground
And tell X of the death of kings

How some have been deposed; some slain in war,
Some haunted by the ghosts  they have deposed;
Some poison'd by their wives: some sleeping kill'd
All murder'd for within the X
That rounds the mortal temples of a King
Keeps death his court
