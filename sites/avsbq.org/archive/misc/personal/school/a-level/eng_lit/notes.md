however the mariner may have been forgiven by others but he cannot be forgiven by himself moreover is forced by his guilt to travel from 'land to land' to tell his tale for eternity. forgiveness may be achieved but absolution is not as the ariner may be free from external consequences but the internal consequences of his guilt and sense of responsibility torment him. an important element of crime is the concept of guilt, congession and the desire to be forgiven. after being punished and forgiven by external forces, self punishment is the only thing left.

coleridge, uses one of the spirits to say ' and more penance more will do' penance is self punishment done to try to right a wrong, or the receipt of absolution from sin from a priest by fullfilling some requirement. perhaps retelling his story could be seen like catholic confession draws parallel, perhaps coleridge is consciously likening the two but you only have to confess from sins once so this implies a stricter punishment
