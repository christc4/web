# Exchange rates

Although floating exchange rates have their many beneifts, it isn't uncommon that countries decide to implement fixed exchange rates against other currencies, for example the UAE with America. The UAE stated that this is to promote exchange rate stability, in particular the stability of oil prices following several shocks that have triggered global recessions, i.e. the 1973 oil crisis. As the exchange rate is fixed, there are low levels of uncertainty amongst investors, which the UAE are currently trying to attract as their supply of oil is limited and they attempt to find other ways of remaining a powerful nation.

The Chinese goverment has admitted to managing their exchange rates on multiple occasions for the benefit of their economy. Before the coronavirus pandemic hit, Chinese policymakers would cut interest rates in order to boost exports. By cutting interest rates, there is a net outflow of hot money - money that moves around countries in search of the best return - as the rate of return was considerably lower.The Yuan is then devalued, which makes exports cheaper, hence a rise in demand for them. The Chinese hoped that by doing this it would diminish the power America had over the trade war.
