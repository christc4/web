	\end{minipage}}
	\\\\
	To keep English ‘intact’ in an ever-globalizing world seems impossible; it would require the embalment of the English language. But which version of English? The English spoken in the UK and its numerous dialects? General American English or Indian English which both dominate globally in numbers of speakers? For the purpose of simplicity, keeping a language ‘intact’ suggests that future generations will speak a version of language which differs slightly or not at all in terms of grammar, vocabulary and intelligibility between past, present and future speakers. This essay will take a three-pronged approach towards answering the question, “Can we really keep English intact” through analyzing how English has changed over time, English in an ever-globalizing world and efforts to preserve "purity" in the English language.  \\\\
	Nearly a millennia ago, those inhabiting Wessex, Mercia and Northumbria would have all spoken English. Of course, English is no longer isolated to three dissolved Angle kingdoms and nor is it intelligible with the English used by the Anglo-Saxons. Instead, English has been on an organic millennium-long journey, shedding its original grammar rules of case systems, inflexions and much of its vocabulary. We can only speculate how a conversation between an English speaker from Massachusetts and a Saxon farmer would have fared. But the idea is fascinating as it reveals how poorly Old English vocabulary has been kept ‘intact’. Describing food between the two would be challenging; centuries after the Norman invasion French culinary words displaced their Saxon counterparts, becoming placed on a higher register. Pig, cu and sheep could be used to describe both the living animal and cooked animal yet over time these became distinct from Porc, Bouef and Mouton (Pork, beef and mutton). French vocabulary was not simply added into circulation but outright replaced words such as wittan with parliament. 60\% of Modern English vocabulary has origins in Latin and French and while it was not unheard of to hear Latin in sermons and prayers. An average Saxon farmer would struggle to decipher meaning of much of Modern English vocabulary as would someone with Massachusetts hearing archaic Old English vocabulary. By analyzing our vocabulary further, then the most common words in circulation are to un-English in origin. We might as well be speaking old Norse with words such as anger, Thursday, ill, ugly and wrong all originating from angr, thors day, syk and rangr. That isn’t to say grammar has been kept more ‘intact’. Apart from odd instances of blond vs blonde, our bygone genders of masculine, feminine and neuter don’t exist. English has largely lost its nominative case system of nominative, accusative, genitive, dative and instrumental case. Furthermore, extended interaction with speakers of the Old Norse language, less stress had been placed on inflectional endings which led to their disuse in speech. Could it not be said, that extended interactions with non-English speakers will lead modern-day English to lose its current grammatical features and lose or pick up new vocabulary?  \\\\
	In 1877, Henry Higgans the professor of ‘phonetics’ from the film My Fair Lady, prophetically predicted that after 100 years the English spoken in Australia, Britain and the USA would become distinct mutually unintelligible varieties. His prediction was wrong; English remains intelligible between these 3 countries. Yet does intelligibly between these three countries serve as the acid-test to determine whether English has remained intact? Indian Linguist Braj-ji argues that when considering English internationally, there exists three circles of English. The innermost circle consists of the English used in the: UK, USA, Australia, New Zealand and Canada. Whereas outer circles consist of Nigerian English, Singapore English and Indian English. Intelligibility remains between all varieties mentioned but the English in the outer circle features unique language features absorbed from the native languages used in the aforementioned countries. Braj-ji further argues that Business English taught internationally considers non-native verities as inferior, which begs the question who decides what English is. While the government of the Philippines encourages formal English who is to say Taglish or the Singlish which dominates Singaporean homes, both featuring infusions from Tagalog/Malay plus Chinese, are not English? Since there is no board regulating what is considered English are creole and pidgin English not considered English? Unlike Samuel Johnson’s 1755 dictionary definition of English, “belonging to England, thence English is the language of England”. English belongs to no one country and has left a global footprint in much of the world. To suggest English remains intact excludes the fact that the varieties of English already offer distinct differences in grammar and vocabulary.  \\\\
	It is important not to gloss over existing English dialects. African American Vernacular English has specific grammatical rules such as double negatives or negative inversion and Cockney English too offers unique language features such as rhyming slang. Dialects have evolved alongside standard English, is it not arguable that dialects have swayed from what is mainstream? If it was possible without banning any deviation from dictionary English, then we would never see any dialect of English crop up. Yet the 160 documented English dialects that exist suggest otherwise. If efforts were focused on keeping formal written English ‘intact’ then it is indeed possible to keep the grammar rules enforced similarly to written Latin. Perhaps what is needed is a regulatory body for the English language, such as the Académie Française which dictates what can and cannot enter the French dictionary. Alternatively, movements such as Anglish exist and possibly ‘intactness’ can be better achieved by reverting to an earlier form of English vocabulary wise. Anglish is a language movement which aims to “cleanse” English of unnecessary foreign words (mostly Greek/Latin vocabulary). Anglish aims to tackle communication difficulties by creating new compound words as a replacement of familiar words. Take for example the noun umbrella which is an Italian loan word that can be substituted by the new word “rainshade” a combination of rain plus shade. However, Anglish also aims to revive Anglo Saxon or Germanic words, now deemed as Archaic. However, can it not be argued that going back in time, vocabulary-wise, can be interpreted to suggest Modern English is no longer ‘intact’ as it loses its current vocabulary composition – coining new words? Anglish although receiving an increase in traction, remains a niche concept, no official education institutes promote Anglo-Saxon vocabulary over their Latin counterparts.  
	\\\\
	In conclusion, if we are to keep English as it is intact it would be un-organic in every sense English has developed. The English language has travelled far beyond Europe and the Mediterranean filling its basket with foreign loanwords. Just as Latin had fallen, and given rise to new languages of Italian, French and Spanish. Who is to say English cannot also fall, surviving in written form but conversationally becoming un-intact? In any case, it is a herculean task to keep ‘intact’ a language with 450 million speakers, unless a movement such as Anglish gains more traction. Yet this too only tackles the vocabulary side of language; it would require mass language schools to instruct a generation of Modern English speakers to use archaic forms of inflexions and learn the case system. Perhaps to facilitate easier communication in an ever-globalizing world the English, as we know today, will lose many grammatical features and shed more vocabulary; thus, the concept of ‘intactness’ shatters and is purely theoretical.

	    \textbf{Written Work 2: A brief summary of the changes to: cut, fit and fabric in mens suiting}
	\end{minipage}}
	\\\\
	The epitome of formality for most of the world remains the suit. In its strictest sense, the modern suit consists of trousers and a lapelled coat made from matching fabric. Yet at its birth in the early 19th century, the suit was the antithesis of formality. The concept of a “suit” first came about in what was the “lounge suit”, which was first created in Scotland from hardy tweeds and worsted wool cloths. Although side-by-side photos with its modern-day counterpart reveal some similarities the: cut, fit and fabric are strikingly different and changes to these terms throughout time reveal much about societal attitudes and fashion.  
	\\\\
	Cut, which refers to how cloth is cut by a tailor or machine, determines how a garment hangs from a person's body and difficult to alter features such as length. Originally, the “lounge suit” was much shorter than the existing: frock, tail and morning coats which were often knee length as opposed to lounge-suit which would only cover the wearer’s behind. Moreover, early iterations of the lounge-suit were very sack-like in appearance lacking any real shape as per the wearers natural body. Excess fabric in the back and chest panels contributed to this sack-like appearance and would persist until the 1920s, in which the concept of suit was much more: defined, mainstreamed and streamlined. The 1920s saw fit, the way in which a garment hugs a body, seeking much of its inspiration from the hourglass body shape. Shoulders and hips were kept the same size, padding was sometimes used to accentuate a man’s hips to keep up with the width of his natural shoulders. Moreover, trousers were tapered and had a half break, resting above the outermost shoelace. Front darts were being introduced more which took in excess fabric in the chest and back panel allowing the garment to much better hug the wearers natural body. Changes in fabric from the Victorian period were slight, central heating was yet to be invented so the heaviness of fabrics persisted, and wool weaving technology had improved slightly leading fabrics to be slightly less coarse. Although, the 1900s to 1910s seem to get glossed over as these years lacked the discernable defining features what consisted of a suit drastically changed from this period to the 20s. The number of garments worn with a suit would decrease significantly, the 1900 to 1910s saw men often wearing stiffened detachable collars and cuffs, often made from celluloid and starched industrially. Men would also wear bib fronts which gave the appearance of a stiff shirt-front and spats on their shoes. This practice would fall out of favor and only gave rise to less garments involved in suiting. The 1930s saw suits becoming more V shaped, the equal width with shoulders and hips was deemed less masculine and the prominence of heavily padded shoulders saw the prior fall out of fashion. The trousers became much fuller in cut and fit wise were tapered significantly less than their 20s counterparts often now featuring 2-inch cuffs. It is important to mention very little about the waistcoat that had changed from the Victorian era, yet the 40s would see this essential garment see very little use. Suits in the 40s were much more proportioned, like modern suits, although more square-like in appearance as heavy shoulder padding was still the norm. Fabric rationing during the second world war meant many manufacturers would stop production of waistcoats and as compromise the manufacturing of double-breasted suits increased as showing “too much shirt” was deemed casual. The cut also changed significantly as trousers were now being cut with a shorter rise and rationing of fabric meant brace (suspender) production halt. Trousers would no longer sit at the natural waistline, roughly around one's bellybutton, but sit far below it which gave rise to the belt in suiting.  Trouser cuffs would also fall out of favor to save on cloth. As a result, the military began issuing suits to men returning from the second world war, demob suits, yet due to an inconsistency of sizing many men would complain about the fit and sizing being existent, leading many men with much exaggerated features such as jacket length. The 1950s and 1960s saw the rise of the drape-cut, pioneered by British tailoring house Anderson & Sheppard, which features a distinctive fullness through the chest and shoulder blades accompanied with an oversized skirt to promote the view of a fuller broader chest. Waistcoats would almost totally disappear from mainstream suiting by this point, seen more in wedding photography and by older gentlemen; although the rise of “disco-wear” in the 70s saw a small resurgence often in flashy colors.  Suiting during the 1970s was experimental in nature, seeing the cut of trousers bottoms becoming wider leading to the invention of bell bottoms and 5–6-inch lapels. Fabric would begin to change rapidly with synthetic materials such as polyester, nylon and rayon becoming a staple in mass-produced suiting.  Moreover, fabric weaving had improved significantly, and wool mills could now produce much lighter wool, which ultimately affected how suits draped on one's body; leading suiting from the 70s onward to feature less drape.  The trend of “flare, bell bottoms and wide lapels” would not persist and the 80s and 90s sobered in terms of cut and fit, although the power-suit was prominent in wall street which included a lower buttoning point to create a distinct V-shape shirt front and heavily padded shoulders.  Modern-day suiting has some holdovers from the 20s especially in terms of taperdness and the slim cut, while trouser rise generally remains low in comparison to pre 40s and jacket length often no longer covers the seat.
