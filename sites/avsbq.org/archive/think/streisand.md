Try to hide, or otherwise draw attention away from something - only serves to attract more attention to it.

Name comes from singer/actress Barba Streisand's lawsuit against a photographer in 2003.

Kenneth Adelman (photographer), shot Californian coastline, posting the photos online, as free nonprofit images. Amongst 12,000 photos, one was Streisand's mansion.
