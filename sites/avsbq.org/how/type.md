# How to Type

<details><summary>Unfurl for personal story</summary> The year is 2018. I am sitting at my form room computer, a bespectacled friend gafawks at my typing speed. He has just learned to touch type. The year is 2020. A nerd comes up to me while typing in the library. He calls me unbeliavably slow. The years following... I channel mana through my fingers, effortlessly gliding and dancing with the keys.</details>

<details><summary>Unfurl for me mocking people</summary> What's hilarious is that you have people whose fulltime job is to type, type, type - yet twenty years later they can only type at a snails pace. Why? Because, you need to consciously change existing typing habits in order to become faster.</details>
