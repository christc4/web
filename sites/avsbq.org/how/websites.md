# How I do websites

*Last update: 2024/09/09*

I use a heavily modified and stripped-down version of [werc](https://werc.cat-v.org), _a minimalist web anti-framework_. In fact it's so modified I'm surprised it even _works_

I never did manage to set werc up manually with nginx or httpd, until I discovered this amazing script which automates the process on OpenBSD, which conveniently is the server OS I run. The script, [werc-on-openbsd](https://github.com/EdoardoLaGreca/werc-on-openbsd).

I write everything in markdown, with occasional pinches of html.

## Currently

My domain registar is epik and my VPS is vultr.

## Backups

As of right now, I run a [script](https://hbk.avsbq.org/cs

## Previously

I used .shtml, which is html with server side includes (SSI).


This allowed for commonly used elements like the <footer> or <header> to be inserted by simply typing...

`<#include file="/headers">`

If you are interested in .shtml read my [guide](https://hbk.avsbq.org/cs/web/shtml)

## Ideally&hellip;

Down the line I'll buy a coreboot/librebooted NAS, so I can run instances/front-ends of various sites, like how [tux.pizza](https://tux.pizza/services/) does things.

What I would like are my own instances of

- Peertube
- Whoogle
- Invidious
- Git

I no longer use this but [landchad.net](https://landchad.net) has everything you need to know about aquiring a domain and setting up your first website (alongside various other self-hosting services)
