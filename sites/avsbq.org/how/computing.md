# Everything you'd want to know about my computing

*Last updated: 2024/09/05*

## Ergonomics

Ergonomics is first and foremost, you only have one body. Take care of it. 

I strictly use a standing desk. 

Standing desks by themselves can become torturous after the 4 hour mark, to mitigate this I'm researching walking treadmills or rollers.

I roll my shoulders and do neck-stretches.

When not typing I keep my wrists in a neutral position. I also try to nudge my mouse/trackball while my wrists are neutral

## Hardware

I use what I guess you'd call a &apos;headless&apos; laptop,

<img src=".pix/headless_x230_01.avif" style="width: 450px; height: auto;">

It's the motherboard of a corebooted ThinkPad x230

It is quite an exhibitionist... And I've now elevated it for better airflow.
Sidenote: Laptops with their motherboards encased feels like leaving your child in a locked car on a sweltering hot day :)

## Software
