# How to avoid RSI 

*Last update: 2024/09/02*

_"Scrimping on pennies will cost you pounds in the long run"_

## The feeling itself

RSI for me feels like if someone cleanly sliced of my wrist but the only thing holding it together is the blood coagulating, henceforth any typing movements or God-forbid calisthenics during a rsi flare can be extraordinarily painful

## Avoid repetitive movements

If you're trade is photo/video editing/programming look into how the pro's minimise repetitive keystrokes.

Having said that, you'll probably be herded into using a sequence of key-presses i.e. "Ctrl + ..." or even "C-Shift + ...".

As I said in the beginning, scrimping on pennies isn't good, get a macro pad and program it for said repetitive tasks.

## Total abstinence isn't the best

Total abstinence from the mouse won't solve or prevent RSI,

## Avoid wrist contortions

If you are for reasons unkown to use a laptop.. don't twist your wrist at the touchpad, move your entire forearm to control the cursor or gesture
