# How I do fitness

*Last update: 2024/09/07*

I am not a fitness guru or fanatic. No-one is 'fit', fit-for-the-job means being adapted for something.. If you go to the gym a lot you are 'fit' for moving man-made weights in a metal building, if you are a 'runner' you are 'fit' for running aimlessly.. not delivering letters in the midst of war.. Your body will naturally atrophy if you pack on muscle, it was not designed and doesn't intend to gain more muscle than you need naturally

Having said this, I do some basic exercises, dips, pullups and squat/lunge

I also try to walk two hours each day, ideally on a canal footpath or through a park, as London is heavily polluted

If you have a job or are at school, go to bathroom once a day - start doing pullups. Eventually you become part of the background decoration and people stop taking notice.

NOTE: I never ever wrapped the toilet bar, someone inspired by me did this. Use shoulder pads from old suit or cloth to wrap your palm. This is a desecration of my college's bathroom

note to self: include your old wrap photo

Completely idiotic picture.. Stress kills you. Cardio is not natural..

Left-hand man is a steroid junkie, right hand man eats too much food, causing stress on his digestive system
