# How I do fitness

I am not a fitness guru or fanatic

No-one is 'fit', fit-for-the-job means being adapted for something.. Gym-goers lifting man-made weights are fit for just that and the same goes for calisthenics practicioners, swimmers and runners. No one is training to exchange letters in the frenzy of war. Our body naturally atrophys if you pack on muscle, it was not and never designed to be subject to frequent muscle fibre tearing and rebuilding

Having said this, I do some basic exercises every once in a while, dips, pullups and squat/lunge

This is mainly to alleviate pain from aforementioned muscular atrophy, which is because I spent my teenager years pointlessly going to the gym and without 'training' my body experiences 'withdrawl symptons' aka return to factory settings.

I also try to walk two hours each day, ideally on a canal footpath or through a park, as London is heavily polluted

IDEALLY, ones 'fitness' should be going on hikes with their siblings/kids and finding cool rocks but if you must you don't need equipment. If you want to gain natural useful strength then basic calisthenics is useful, as long as you don't go crazy with it

If you have a job or are at school, go to bathroom once a day - start doing pullups. Eventually you become part of the background decoration and people stop taking notice.

NOTE: I never ever wrapped the toilet bar, someone inspired by me did this. Use shoulder pads from old suit or cloth to wrap your palm. This is a desecration of my college's bathroom

note to self: include your old wrap photoA



Completely idiotic picture.. Stress kills you. Cardio is not natural..

Left-hand man is a steroid junkie, right hand man eats too much food, causing stress on his digestive system
