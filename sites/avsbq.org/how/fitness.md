# How I do fitness

Last update: 2024/07/21

I am not a fitness guru or fanatic.

See me do pull-ups, [here](https://vid.avsbq.org/mis/per/pul.webm)

## Calisthenics or weight-lifting

You want to be big - lift weights.

You want to be mobile, strong and stuff - do calisthenics.

Got the zeal? Why not do both?

## Rant

Extremely compromised people spout how they have zero time to work out.

If you have a job or are at school, go to bathroom maybe twice or three times a day - start doing pullups or wall pushups, with a backpack. Eventually you become part of the background decoration and people stop taking notice.

NOTE: I never ever wrapped the toilet bar, someone inspired by me did this. Use shoulder pads from old suit or cloth to wrap your palm. This is a desecration of my college's bathroom

note to self: include your old wrap photo

## Friends

Having friends is nice.

Having friends who workout with you is nicer.

'Friends' who treat working out like kryptonite are partly compromised people - so be wary of them
