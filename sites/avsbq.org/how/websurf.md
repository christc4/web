# How I surf the web

## Use wiby ;)

Don't expect to find any niche hobbyist cites indexed by the major search engines, so just use [wiby.me](https://wiby.me)

## Sites link to other sites

Or atleast they used to.

Some sites, have a backwards and forwards arrow somewhere on their page so you can go to and fro their friends sites.

I think it's called a webring.

## Other

I have no clue what neocities is, if someone can fill me in that'd be great
