# How I surf the web

*Last update: 2024/09/07*

## Circles

If you are in programming/software circles, you might catch people in passing mention beautiful sites like 'cat-v.org' or xyz minimalist high-quality crafted site. *NOT* ai or corporate or bloated-for-profit page...

## Use wiby ;)

Don't expect to find any niche hobbyist cites indexed by the major search engines, so just use [wiby.me](https://wiby.me)

## Sites link to other sites

Or atleast they used to.

Some sites, have a backwards and forwards arrow somewhere on their page so you can go to and fro their friends sites.

I think it's called a webring.

## Other

I have no clue what neocities is, if someone can fill me in that'd be great
