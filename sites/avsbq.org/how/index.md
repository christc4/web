# How

<pre>	
Part-time,
Here-one-day,
Gone-the-next.
Anyhow, I call the crime
Another shade of blueâ€”
You know who.

Howsoever, I'll be next,
Slipping through the cracks,
A ghost of yesterday,
Or the shadow of tomorrow.
The "how" remains,
Unsolved, untouched,
But I'll be there
When the light bends
And the story twists again.

My truth knows has no ends
</pre>
