POSIX (Portable Operating System Interface) is *the* standard UNIX shell - standard as in formally defined and shipped in a published standard, making shell scripts written for it portable. POSIX, is essentially a formalized version of Bourne.

It is found in /bin/sh, although it may be symlinked to bash
