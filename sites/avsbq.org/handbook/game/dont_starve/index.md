I bought the pack from [gog](https://www.gog.com/en/game/dont_starve_alone_pack_plus) for Â£6.59

This included:

- Don't Starve 
- Reign of giants
- Shipwrecked
- Hamlet

## Difference between 'Don't Stave' and 'Don't Stave Together'?

_Don't Starve_ is single-player, _Don't Starve Together_ is multiplayer.

Unlike DST where you can play as any character of the bat, DS requires you to gain experience or complete in-game events to unlock characters.

## Linux compatibility

This worked perfectly fine in artix linux, running on my ThinkPad x230.

I only needed to install `libcurl-gnutls`

They are wonderful
## My guide

obviously not as in depth as the above 2...

### food

only attack butterflies, once they're busying themselves with flowers, otherwise you'll never catch up to them.

stock up on their wings - they recover 8 hunger

### resources

break down pig homes with a hammer, for boards and pigskin

You are lucky if you find an underground cave with sleeping bed, science machine etc.
