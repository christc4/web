# Repair mangled paint brush

- Cut of offending bristles
- Apply conditioner and shape the brush
	- If fine point brush, shape with fingers clockwise, if wide brush shape normally

## Background information

I had a pretty mangled brush, I forgot to take a photo of the crows-nest on my brush.

It's like giving your brush a haircut but instead it won't grow back
