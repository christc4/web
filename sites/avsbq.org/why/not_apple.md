# Why not Apple? (todo)

*Last update: 2024/09/07*

Apple products are truly superior in many-many metrics to its competitors but I take a huge issue regarding their ergonomics, modularity etc. I also know them to be an unethical evil company. Their advertising and their 3d emojis (todo) I find incredibly creepy

Apple software, I lived in it for a year or two with my Macbook 12", it is extremely comfortable - but unethical proprietary, 

In fact, I only bought my old MacBook which had one stupid usb-c port, to boot Linux
