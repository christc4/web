# Why I started websites

*Last update: 2024/09/19*

Humans have many interests that we can speak glowingly about - maybe you have more than one interest. Golden nuggets swimming in your cerebrospinal fluid... Actual gold wont tarnish of course, but our memories do deteriorate... Eventually, you'll lose interest in said topic or die unexpectedly and thus your profound expertise is flushed down the drain.

# What if no-one visits avsbq.org?

Visitors are always welcome - plenty of refreshments - but the age of great web exploration is long over - these pages are to serve as a static record. Paper burns, tears, crumples, gets lost. 

# Why not use...

Medium, SubStack, flickr, pinterest, imgur etc?

Because then you are not a WebMaster but a WebSlave

Those sites push skittles and are very likely to ban me!
