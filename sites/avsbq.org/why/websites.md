# Why I do websites

*Last update: 2024/07/22*

Imagine you have an interest you speak glowingly about - maybe you have many interests. Golden nuggets bathing in your cerebrospinal fluid... Real gold doesn't tarnish of course, but memories do deteriorate... Eventually, you'll lose interest in said topic, with your profound expertise flushed down the drain.

# What if no-one visits avsbq.org?

Visitors always welcome - plenty of refreshments! - but the age of great web exploration is long over - these sites are for my future children.

# Why not use...

Medium, SubStack, flickr, pinterest, imgur etc?

Because then you are not a WebMaster but a WebSlave

Those sites push skittles and are very likely to ban me!
