I originally titled this, _bread and circuses_.

In reference to something Juvenal said,

> _"Give them bread and circuses and they will never revolt"_

I'll start of with a very basic observation, which is necessary, as it explains the habits of a population in their later years.

People who couldn't kick a ball if their life depended on it, and the latest football transfers were the talk of the town.
