# Coffee naming convention

I remember in my naive adolesence, I had decided to enter a coffee sshop for the first time and ask for a black coffee and the man behind the counter asked if I wanted an americano. Never had I felt so shocked, it was as if I had strutted their butt-naked apart from a tie, only to be revealed at the counter that the English I had learned for the past 18 years was no good here. Imagine the first ever person to be told his cold-hard cash is no good and it's a contactless store

After some internet sleuthing it seems that the term Americano originates from American G.Is stationed at Italy in WW2, whereby they'd dilute espresso with hot water

After some even more internet sleuthing it turns out [all americano is black coffee but not all black coffe is americano](https://qavashop.com/en/academy/Post/the-difference-between-americano-and-black-coffee), at this point I'm just gonna hang up my hat - I'm not a coffee connoisseur
