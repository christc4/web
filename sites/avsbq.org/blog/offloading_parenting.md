# Offloading parenting

Offloading parenting is the shulking of father/motherly duties onto others. The closest word in modern exchange is  'outsourcing'

> _where you move internal operations to a third party_

At its core, imagine it as passing the parental torch onto total strangers.

To prime our brains let's disect the commonmost scenarios.

## Scenario A

A dad never begins a  fitness regimen with his son. Young and impressionable he sees all his role-models in great shape - as are the most popular students in school. All of a sudden. Enraptured by a male influencer covertly peddling corruption into their self-help story - his working out stems from their influence.

Label this wellspring of motivation as a:

- grifter
- con-artist
- snake-oil salesman

It doesn't matter. Your points no matter how true they ring become null and void. Your standing as a man of fitness is non-existant.

GradeA example of offloading, parents far and large criminally downplay fitness. 

In so many scenarios where parents whine about how their son was duped by an online fitness guru - ask them if they offloaded their fitness instructor role to some dude on a yacht.

## Scenario B

Every child has a natural affinity to games,

That doesn't mean a parent has to do his homework on every triple A title and grind hours in a battle royale

Knowing about board gamees, dice games, card games, indie games, story games, point and click, RTS doesn't hurt you,

Introduce them to decent normal games that can be used as a teaching tool otherwise some YouTuber will peddle harmful idealogiges in his gaming content

### Anecdote time

I can contribute two personal encounters to the scenario count.

While doing calisthenics outdoors, a Dad came up to me - seemingly out of nowhere and unexpectedly - he wanted to thank me - he said I had textbook form and used me to demonstrate what a pullup should look like. 

Another occasion, I overheard a family passing by me. Their son tugged at his Dad and pointed, "Can you do that". Their dad was in poor shape, and I can only imagine what he responded in passing.

I'm not a fitness fanatic and need to improve in many areas myself but the point remains.

## What isn't offloading?

You'd be right to point out, not everyone is a physicist, would I be offloading my parental duties by hiring a Physics tutor to teach my child? Let's touch back on the definition of outsourcing,

> to move core operations to a third party

no matter how painful it may be, I think to cover elementary basics of any STEM subjects require us to pick up a textbook and get to grips with whatever topic needs teaching. Or... ask a friennd to tutor your child.

Well, ask your friend. Keep a breadth of wise, knowledgeable friends. Friends that are good at manual work and those that are more scientifically suited.

With friends, you can vet them, with teachers and tutors not so much. Of course everyone has skeletons in their closet. But I like to think our friends are on our side. 

## Who is most guilty of  this

When I was younger, I loved seeing rural American families pass on hunting skills to their kids, I think urbanites are most guilty of this

### Solutions

People can be lazy, unwilling, neglecent. Morally compromised. People might also not know any better. In a parent's heart of hearts I like to believe they already know what they think of the term 'offloading'
