# Book review

I am not so much interested in scrutinizing these as literary works. I would have just stopped reading and not bothered to write about these, if they were a drab and didn't read well.

For legal reasons, I AM NOT endorsing any of the views held. This page is entirely meant for educational reasons - just as how Wikipedia or Britanica faces no trouble for covering these titles.

I am a baptised Orthodox Christian and am not aiming to scandalize anyone.

I like many others were led to believe that being sentenced to do time in a Norweigan prison is like being told to live in a 5 star hotel. Maybe, that rings truer today - but it certainly can't be said of what Varg has experienced.

Knowing Varg didn't come out his Mother's womb with a ferro rod and kindling makes me feel a lot better when it comes to survivalism.
