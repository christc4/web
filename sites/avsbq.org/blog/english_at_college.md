# English at College

*Last update: 2024/09/09*

*Note to reader*: I'm from the UK, 'college' is used interchangably with the proper term 'sixth-form' which refers to one's schooling from age 16 to 18. I would use 'sixth-form' if people outside the UK knew what that meant..

An interesting phenemonom studying English-Literature.

I asked all of my English Literature teachers, one had PhD, one studied at Oxford, other at Cambridge and teaches at the prestiguous Eton college, have they ever published book/poem or if I can read their writings that are not essays on other peoples work.

They all said no and one teacher said very coyly, she is a poet but it's personal and she would feel embarassed sharing.

That's interesting, a lot of poets or authors, they wanted their work to be burned by a friend upon their death, instead their friend marvelling about their work gets it published and so many years later we end up studying it under an academic lens..

What I find even more fascinating, is that as my eyes crawled through some of the books we studied, it felt like a stream of consciousness of a deadman, is being injected into me, and so I started committing passing phrases, wordy english words to memory, writing them down. Instead of analysing it and breaking it down, I filled my spare pages, with beautiful paragraph openings and sentence types. I felt so compelled to write afterwards.

Maybe this is why I got a B, after sitting the exam two-times
