# A lonely business

The happiness in this world has been paid by different prices

Ryu Mikoto, is a 63 year old businessman.

Ryu know with no safety net to fallback on or crutch to lean on, most of those men would find their way to the bottle, with all hell breaking loose back home

The slow patter and dragging of their soles were funeral-music and nowhere else in the city could he hear such footsteps.

During his stint at upper-management, Ryu would weed out dozens of what he deemed paper-pushers

are you criminal maastermind

One day he had bit of more than he could chew

As he lurched towards the door, a bright voice.. clear as a ell, its sweet sound washing the days stresses from his memory.

demonization

Not withstanding

This was all so unbecoming

A whole cloud of flies 

dregs of society

i suggest you chaannel it into 

resourceful to begin with

students using phones and tablets as computer surrogates

bewildered as to why thinggs dont work

empower

let us skip the useless pleasantries

everything  must be brought to daylight

this would certainly tip the scale wildyl in favor

he makes other politicans look like saints

invisiblee jew

stomach tied in knots
