Homes werent as is the case today with enough food to withstand a medieval seige, a chance visitor could near on bankruptmourmpontry 
picture a perched precariously Esc

wearisome tirade


make a short story with words like

the smell of rotting flesh radiated of the hallway, folly veiled threat
well watchinig you wolf it down

i want to close the gap between fact and friction as much as i can 

with u at the the helm, it looks as though her life is in a backpack, 

wont take no for an answer,

simmer down


he contiuned his methodical sweep

as he swept over the left side of the  kitcheen door frame - the rumble jumped to a piericnif shriek& d
