# Misplaced jewel DRAFT

> She caught my eye so much so - I couldn't see anything else

I start writing something down but the entire bus jolts so what became a blissfull train of thoughts is now one long scraggly line. And I disembarked it never struck me how without the meticulously pruned parade of plants, Stratford would be just another blot of grey

Looking down the barrel of a free period was always the better option to whatever classes I had lined up. Vigorously wash my face, any pat dry. 

Swept up in such peaceful moments it's easy to lose track of whatever you're doing 

But nothing could have braced myself for who I would see momentarily shortly.

Describe doing some computer work. But she - she looked like she had fallen through a Victorian time-machine, play the perfect role of a doting wife

And as she told me about it as someone whos never researched this topic this debate was like drinking from a hose
burn the sight onto your eyelid
genuine unadultered

Surely the law of averages meant that I'd have a shot 

A misplaced jewel and I welded to my seat,, thumping up and down like a jackhammer

I would never see her again.
