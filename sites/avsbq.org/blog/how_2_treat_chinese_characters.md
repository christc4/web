Imagine, you live in an uncontacted tribe and the concept of 'sharing a file' or 'contactless payment' is beyond your brain. Maybe, a smart member of the tribe, could see what these symbols represent, perhaps llikening the waves to a ripple in water, or the share dots as links, or the arrows as a continuation of something.

But for the most part, these symbols are more about memorisation than understanding.

_redacted_ says,

`I don't see how it's unintuitive. The icon is an undirected graph where each node is a person, and each edge denotes a sharing action`

Maybe you can think conceptually like _redacted_

For me it looks like two vintage dumbbells
