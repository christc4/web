# Perversion of Student Beans

Got this email, from Student Beans a company that has codes for student discounts.

They are offering discounts for s&ast;x toys.

Love  honey was founded by two Brits, Neal Slateford and Richard Longhurst 

They are responsible for one in three s&ast;x toys sold in the UK - with one of their most popular being the 'Great American Challenge', a 32-inch dil&ast;o.

This is very sad to see, this email being sent out en-masse to university students.

> For the lips of a strange woman drop as an honeycomb, And her mouth is smoother than oil: But her end is bitter as wormwood, Sharp as a twoedged sword. Her feet go down to death; Her steps take hold on hell
