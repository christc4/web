# Races think as a collective

Whenever, I bring up that 'races think as a collective' people assume I believe that there is a central hive mind. Obviously, this is not what I'm talking about and my belief is a historic view.

Now, if I am to bring any anecdotal evidence on the table - this is probably enough to completely dismiss me and this article as hogwash. But to prime your brain and for you to understand my perspective here I go.

I went to a highly-multicultural sixth-form, my secondary school was pretty-much overrun with Bengali's (specifically the Syhleti variant). In this sixth-form, 'surprisingly enough' all the Bengali's formed tight knit friendships, the negro's formed tight-knit and so did the Filipinos. 

What this means, on a much larger scale, is what it means to put into political power someone from a non-white collective.

In the case of the UK, it seems the white liberal is unable to understand what it really means to elect a non-white MP.

Reducing humans to factions, tribes or stripes people become very jittery and are put on red alert. Maybe, because I am a colored man myself, I get away with saying these things. Mind you, the elder Bengali generation agree with what I am saying, in fact Bengali's are extremely factional and so are lots of Africans.
