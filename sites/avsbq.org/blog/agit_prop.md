# Agitation Propaganda

*Last update: 2024/09/09*

I never heard the term 'agit-prop' until Luke Smith mentioned it in passsing one livestream... Luke basically framed its meaning through the lenses of the TrumpXHilary period of American politics. Where you'd be certain to see a dime-a-dozen reaction channels, left or right, doing one thing and one thing only - reacting.

Sure some of them, had pithy remarks, memorable reactions and gave guidance here and there on how to steer the country but the main kicker we all got from watching them was seeing them get 'mad'. They wouldn't have gotten nearly the reception had they shot a one hour video deconstructing the presedential candidates promises point-by-point.

Plekhanov's distinction follows...

_"A propagandist presents many ideas to one or a few people, an *agitator*  on the other hand presents only one or a few ideas to a mass of people"_

_"Agitation is thus the use of political slogans and half-truths to exploit the grievances of the public and thereby to mold public opinion and mobilize public support"_

Is there a time and place for anger? Yes there's righteous indignation!

If this blog post can tell you anything I want it to be this...

A disillusioned hippy and an discontent off-grider both unhappy with international banking, governments etc. may agree on 80 percent of things when it comes to environmentalism...

Instead of voicing anger at XYZ, do ABC.

Try promote healthy beliefs so what's bad falls by the wayside...

Of course nothing is as rosy as a blog post makes it out to be - but it's a start
