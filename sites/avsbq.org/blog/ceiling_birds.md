# Ceiling birds

*Last update: 2024/08/27*

	Woe betide he who points out the chirp,
	Woe befall on that little twirp,
	Woe befall on the lie and disguise,
	Wise words deludes the skies inside,
	Woe belies on the comfort they nurse,
	Woe betwixt such nights I can't catch a peep,
	Where danger hides close, but shun he who speak,
	Woe behest the silence they keep!
	For the beeping grows louder, yet words remain weak
	Woe beseech they who slumber in peace,
	Woe beget fate which they will ignore,
	The sound of the chirp which warns from the core,
	For the lie whispers calm, while the flames seek the door,
	And woe shall awaken too late to implore

I made a video on such [ceiling birds](https://youtube.com/shorts/bKbdi1G5Oh0?si=UHr-dlNCgKe6NF_M)

Crappy poems aside, smoke detector beeping is a real issue.
