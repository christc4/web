# How to Type

<details><summary>Unfurl for personal story</summary> The year is 2018. I am sitting at my form room computer, a bespectacled friend gafawks at my typing speed. He has just learned to touch type.

I channel mana through my fingers, effortlessly gliding and dancing with the keys.</details>

Why? Because, you need to consciously change existing typing habits in order to become faster.</details>
