# Wasp 'n Yuppie

*Last update: 2024/09/09*

*Note to reader:* I don't do politics on my site, these are just general observations I've made. I'm from the UK, 'college' is used interchangably with the proper term 'sixth-form' which refers to one's schooling from age 16 to 18. I would use 'sixth-form' if people outside the UK knew what that meant..

At college, noone in my social science classes were familiar with the term 'Wasp' or 'Yuppie'

I'm not really interested in the term Yuppie, moreso on 'wasp' you see because we had a BAME network, and now it's common to see terms like BIPOC online.

I think one reason WASP fell out of favor, is not to due with religion, but atomisation, of a racial collective into individualism.

But the issue is multifaceted and I don't have the interest to get a PhD and do thesis..
