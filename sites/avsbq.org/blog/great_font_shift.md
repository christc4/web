# Great font shift

I am not a font historian or connoisseur.

When I was still in school and looking through past-paper question bank I noticed the really-really old papers were all in serif font whereas anything post 2000 was in nice comforting sans-serif.

Was this a psychological ploy to ease exam-stressed students ? 

Or is this all one big nothing burger
