# Fashionista crime

Fashionista's do a lot of harm to the planet.

They do not understand 'timelessness', they try to revive a period of clothing they have no connection to, resurecting it and increasing the amount of clothes already in circulation, which will now be seen as outdated.

A lot of them who haven't studies classical tailoring proportions make clothes that don't fit well

Priceless or Worthless,

Lifeless or...

NOTE: Fashionista's far and large today are not continuing a long tradition of tailoring, they are incorporating wild and wacky ideas

Fashionistas will take something beautiful like this, forgetting the precise rules regarding armholes, length, etc, distort it, waste scarce resources and continue with themselves
