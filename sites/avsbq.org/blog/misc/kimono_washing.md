_Stiching a kimono back into a tanmono, cleaning it drying it, cutting it and stictching it again..._

Before washing and starching kimonos, we check to see if the color will bleed and if the fabric is durable

All of the stitching on the kimono is removed
This is a time-consuming task as every last stitch must be removed

The unraveled kimono is sewn back together into a roll of fabric
At our shop, we use a special sewing machine to sew the edges

After the edges are sewn and the kimono is returned to its original shape, it is washed with a special detergent and a scrubbing brush
The temperature of the water and the amount of pressure used are adjusted depending on the kimono to remove dirt

The washed cloth is dehydrated and hung outside to dry

The washed rolls of fabric are re-sewn to fit the width of the work area
At this time, any frayed edges are re-sewn

Shinko-bari
For rolls of tsumugi fabric, bamboo sticks with needles on the ends are stretched over the fabric, and wrinkles are smoothed out using the flexibility of the bamboo
As the sticks are stretched at 2cm intervals, approximately 600 sticks are used on one roll of fabric

A natural paste is applied to the stretched cloth with a brush
The thickness of the paste is adjusted according to the quality of the fabric and the season, so this requires years of experience

Dry the roll of fabric with the starch applied
As it dries slowly with the fabric stretched, any wrinkles will disappear

For crepe cloth, the width of the fabric is adjusted by applying steam using a machine called a tenter

The finished cloth is rolled up on a board, laid flat, and bound with thread before being washed and hung
