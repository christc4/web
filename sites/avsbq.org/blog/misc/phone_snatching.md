# Phone snatching, draft

*Last update: 2024/09/04*

Eastern Orthodoxy tradition goes that Lazarus, who was resurrected by Christ, never smiled during the thirty years following his resurrection, worried by the sight of unredeemed souls he witnessed during his four-day tenure in Hell. Yet when he sy someone stealing a pot, he smilingly said: "Clay steals clay".


I had the privilege to see the aftermath of not 1 but 2 phone-snatchings in the Olympic Park, East London.

The first time round, I was filld with immense rage towards the criminal even though I was neither the victim nor did I know him.

The second time around I felt completely apathetic. 

Don't take this as my patronage for villainy
