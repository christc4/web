Can you live a diet purely of rabbit meat?

From the [Jungle, Desert, and Arctic Emergencies Booklet 1941]

"Because of the importance of fats, under no conditions limit yourself to a meat diet of rabbit just because they happen to be plentiful in the region where you are forced down. A continued diet of rabbit will produce rabbit starvation -- diarrhea will begin in about a week and if the diet is continued DEATH MAY RESULT."

[Appian, Wars in Spain, CHAPTER IX]

> These noises caused strange terror in the Roman camp. Their soldiers were sick from want of sleep, and because of the unaccustomed food which the country afforded. They had no wine, no salt, no vinegar, no oil, but lived on wheat and barley, and the flesh of deer and *rabbits* boiled without salt, which caused dysentery, from which many died. 

Basically, you go the way of the lean-mean rabbit you pass out. Not pass out, pass out. Pass out this world
