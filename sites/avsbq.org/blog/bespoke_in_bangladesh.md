# Bespoke in Bangladesh

Suits aren't a thing in Bangladesh.

Bengali's don't know suits. The British know suits. The Italians and Japanese know suits.

That's not to say there aren't talented tailoring houses like "Dapper Bespoke"

You have to be ultra-specific and you're better talking to an older and more-travelled tailor.

Make sure they don't use any fusing or glue in the construction, go for a pure cotton no blended synthetics.
