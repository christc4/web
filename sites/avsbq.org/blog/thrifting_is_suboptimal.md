# Thrifting is suboptimal Draft

Last updated, 2024/04/26

Some people thrift simply because its the more economic option.

Others, deluded by lofty ideas, think they are fighting the big man 'fast fashion' like how people try to stick it to 'big pharma'

The 'holy grails' of thrifting are from a bygone era which you have no connection to - that includes the boxiness of the 80s, funkiness of the 70s. 

Not to mention, the numerous individual anatomical quirks you possess...

Sloping shoulders, one shoulder longer than the other, armhole/scye length...

Thrifting is good at removing clothes out of circulation yes.

But what we really need to breathe life into is the new generation of artisans. 

Bespoke tailors who are capable of weaving together your imaginary threads of the perfect garb into something tangible - that's sculpted to your body.
