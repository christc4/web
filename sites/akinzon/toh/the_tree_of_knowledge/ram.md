RAM - Random Access Memory

Is volatile, loses all its contents when power is turned off and needs a constant supply

Rapid access, can read/write to/from RAM very quickly

Two main types - [DRAM](dram) and [SRAM](sram)

You'll see DDR a lot with RAM - it stands for **Double data rate.** For example, A DDR4 DIMM marked DDR4-4266MHz PC4-34100 Has a bandwidth of 34100 MB/s. This is DDR4 RAM.

DDR5 RAM is much faster, with about double the throughput, and even uses less voltage!!! It also has a greater bandwidth as well.

What is DRAM and SRAM #flashcard 
Dynamic RAM (DRAM) is a type of RAM that stores bits as a charge on capacitors
Static RAM (SRAM) is a type of ram that stores bits using transistors

What is one advantage/disadvantage of DRAM and one for SRAM #flashcard 
DRAM is cheaper to produce, but its charge leaks and must be refreshed
SRAM does not leak like DRAM but is much more expensive
