TARGET DECK

**Divide, and conquer!** The binary search looks at the array as a search zone, and checks if the value it is looking for is greater than or less than the midpoint, (or equal to it!). It will then halve the search zone to be the greater half or the lesser half of the old search zone, until the item is found or until there is no more to search.

Downside it, the list needs to be sorted first!!!
