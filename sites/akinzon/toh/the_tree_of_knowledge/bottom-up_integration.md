TARGET DECK

Bottom-up integration is another kind of incremental integration testing strategy:

The strategy is as follows:
	- Test the [low-level modules](low-level_modules) in [Testing in Isolation|isolation](testing_in_isolation|isolation) 
	- Add the [High-Level Modules|higher-level modules](high-level_modules|higher-level_modules) that call the low-level modules to the test and test them together
	- Repeat the previous step until the highest-level modules have been tested
