To begin with, graphs are denoted by the form: 
$$ G(V, E) $$
$V$ is the [sets|set](sets|set) of nodes/vertices and $E$ is the set of edges.

$M$ is the incidence information we get from E, which can be represented in two ways:

	[Incidence Matrices](incidence_matrices)			
	
	[Incidence Lists](incidence_lists)

$A$ is the adjacency matrix or list we get from $M$, which simply tells is if there is an edge between two nodes and how many. Unlike $M$, it doesn't matter if the way is from $i$ to $j$ or $j$ to $i$, it counts either way.

	[Adjacency Matrices](adjacency_matrices)				
	
	[Adjacency Lists](adjacency_lists)


$D$ denotes the *degree*, which is how many edges touch a node.
It is calculated *like so:*
$$ D = D_{in} + D_{out}$$
Where $D_{in}$ is the number of edges going **into** a node, and 
$D_{out}$ is the number of edges going **out** of a node.
