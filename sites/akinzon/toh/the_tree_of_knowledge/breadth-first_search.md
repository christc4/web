TARGET DECK

Breadth-First Search searches through all vertices in a graph by travelling to a vertex, taking note of all its adjacent vertices, then visiting them one by one and repeating the process.

It is breadth-first because all vertices at a distance $n$ from the start vertex are discovered before going to any vertex at distance $n+1$.

To prevent ourselves from visiting a node more than once, nodes that have not been fully discovered are 'white', and nodes that have been discovered are 'black'.

To begin with, the start node is coloured black.
