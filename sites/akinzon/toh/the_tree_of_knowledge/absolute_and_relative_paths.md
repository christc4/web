**Absolute Paths** - These are detailed paths from the disk's root to the file

**Machine-independent way for finding disk root:**
```java
System.getProperty("user.home");
```

**Relative Paths** - These aren't as detailed as absolute paths, but allow you to start from a specified directory.

We start from `src` as our home.

What is the different between absolute and relative paths #flashcard 
Absolute paths are detailed paths from the disk's root but relative paths start from a specified directory.
