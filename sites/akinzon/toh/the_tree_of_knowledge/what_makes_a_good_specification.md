TARGET DECK


#### Good specifications are..

**Complete:** Everything the system can do must be described, but not all possibilities - there are infinite!

Depending on if this is a [Safety-critical Systems|safety-critical system](safety-critical_systems|safety-critical_system) or not, The completeness of the spec can vary.

**Consistent:** [Requirements](requirements) must not contradict each other, for example a rocket system can't have `must have only one door` and `must have two doors` both in the spec

**Unambiguous:** What is meant by our requirements should be *crystal clear,* we shouldn't be able to interpret requirements in self-contradictory ways.

**Verifiable:** We should be able to show/demonstrate the correctness of the spec/system (using our **success criteria!**)

**Traceable:** Each part of the spec should be able to be traced to some part of the final system. This goes both ways.
