**Best Case:** We find the item immediately. $\Theta(1)$.

**Average Case:** We find the item somewhere near the middle ($n/2$). [Asymptotic Behaviour of the Running Time|asymptotically](asymptotic_behaviour_of_the_running_time|asymptotically), $\Theta(n)$.

**Worst Case:** We never find the item (cry) or it's at the end of the array, meaning we have to traverse through all $n$ items. $\Theta(n)$.
