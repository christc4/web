The stack is a LIFO (Last In, First Out) [Abstract Data Types|abstract data type](abstract_data_types|abstract_data_type)

Its most relevant operations are `push()`, to add data to the top of the stack, `pop()`, to remove it, `peek()`, to look at the topmost item, and `isEmpty()`, to check if the stack is empty (also `isFull()`!)

In computer systems, it's useful when there are a lack of registers, and has a use in the [The Java Stack Frame|stack frame](the_java_stack_frame|stack_frame) where it can store values for subroutine calls.

All stacks have a pointer which "points" to the top of the stack.
