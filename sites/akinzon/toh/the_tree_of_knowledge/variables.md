Variables in programming can be used to store 'things' such as ints, booleans and even user-defined objects!

[Variable Convention](variable_convention)

Variables have values assigned to them using "=". Variables have their values checked using "\==".

Variables in a class are called **member variables**

Variables can store either a [Primitives|primitive](primitives|primitive) type or a reference to an [Objects|object](objects|object).

[Member vs Local Variables](member_vs_local_variables)

What can variable names contain, what can't they start with and why #flashcard 
[Variables|Variable](variables|variable) names can contain letters, numbers, _ and $
Variable names cannot start with numbers or capital letters since capital names are reserved for [Classes](classes).
