When the initial basic solution is not **feasible** (because it is $\lt 0$), the two-phase simplex method is needed.

**[Phase 1 of the Two-Phase Simplex Method|Phase 1](phase_1_of_the_two-phase_simplex_method|phase_1):** Find a feasible solution by minimising an auxiliary function

> [!TIP] When solving the auxiliary function, ALSO apply the row operations to the original [The Objective Function|objective function](the_objective_function|objective_function), this will help you a lot!

**Phase 2:** Use the feasible solution from phase 1 to solve the original [Linear Programming Problems|problem](linear_programming_problems|problem).
