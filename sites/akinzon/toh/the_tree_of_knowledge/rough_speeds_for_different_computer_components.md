**Gigaflops of a CPU:** 50Gflops

**Memory Bandwidth:** 10GBps

**PCIe lane:** You know these, trust yourself

**Hard Disk Speed:** 100MBps

**Gigabit Ethernet:** 100MBps

**SATA SSD read rate:** You're learning this one, 500MB/s

**NVME SSD read rate:** PCIe v3 - 3GBps, PCIe v4 - 4GBps

**All of these figures are not exact, and do not take into account that random access speed is MUCH slower.**
