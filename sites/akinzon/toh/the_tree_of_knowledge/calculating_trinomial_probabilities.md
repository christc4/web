TARGET DECK

A good example for calculating trinomial probabilities is football, where you can either win, lose, or draw.

Say Arsenal (COYG) have a constant win chance of 0.9, a lose chance of 0.01 and a draw chance of 0.09, regardless of the team they play.

Now they play 20 games. 

> [!TIP]- What is the probability they win 10, lose 4 and draw 6?  
> $\mathbb{P}(W=10,\ L=4,\ D=6) = \binom{20}{10,4,6}0.9^{10}0.01^{4}0.09^{6}$
