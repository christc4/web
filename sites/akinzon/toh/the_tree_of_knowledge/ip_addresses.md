### IPv4

Unique 32-bit IP address

Octet-grouped (8 bit), separated by dots

e.g. 192.168.7.1

## We're OUT OF IPv4!!!

How is this mitigated? - [Network Address Translation|NAT](network_address_translation|nat)

### IPv6

128-bit address, delimited by colons, represented in hex

e.g. 2001:630:d0:f111:e07a:b1fa:68a1:80eb

Simpler header compared to IPv4


### Every day I'm tunnellin'...

Tunnelbrokers are used to get IPv6  on an IPv4 connection using tunnelling. It's better than IPv4 but isn't as fast as pure IPv6.

What are the structural and header differences between IPv4 and IPv6? #flashcard 
IPv4 is 4 decimal values of 8 bits each, separated by '.'
IPv6 is 8 hex values of 16 bits each, separated by ':'
IPv6 also has simpler headers
