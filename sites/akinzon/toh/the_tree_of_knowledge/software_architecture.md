Software architecture is the big picture of a system.

It is about as high-level as you can get with a system, at this point it is **self-modelling**.

It describes how the system is fundamentally ordered at its bare minimum, and what it takes to create this system.

It is the **fundamental structure of a system** (but you copied this definition wow)
