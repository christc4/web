Graphs can be represented using [Adjacency Matrices](adjacency_matrices) and [Adjacency Lists](adjacency_lists).

Adjacency lists are usually preferred since they have a $O(|E| + |V|)$ space complexity.

On the other hand, adjacency matrices have a $O(|V|^2)$ space complexity.

They are especially preferred for sparse graphs (where the number of edges is much less than the number of vertices.)

Adjacency matrices are preferred when the graph is dense (approximate number of edges to vertices)

Adjacency matrices edge out adjacency lists here because it is much easier to check for adjacency in a matrix.
