The GPU is a fundamental computer component known as the Graphics processing unit.

In its humble beginnings (<1990s), it was focused on rendering 2D graphics, but by the '90s it was used more commonly for 3D rendering.

**Why do we need GPUs?** - GPUs are much more efficient at per-pixel maths required for graphics rendering/drawing than CPUs.

As we've said, GPUs are indispensable! [GPUs as co-processors](gpus_as_co-processors)
