Encapsulation is all about keeping [Classes](classes) self-reliant, however how does this translate to inheritance??

[Access Levels for Encapsulation|Here are 4 keywords for encapsulation.](access_levels_for_encapsulation|here_are_4_keywords_for_encapsulation.)

The **Protected** keyword can be useful for allowing [subclasses](subclasses) to inherit their [Superclasses|superclass'](superclasses|superclass') methods and attributes.

What's the difference between the private and protected keyword #flashcard 
The protected keyword allows [subclasses](subclasses) to inherit that attribute or [methods|method](methods|method), but private does not.
