# GPUs as co-processors

TARGET DECK

GPUs can be used as co-processors for [The Processor|the CPU](the_processor|the_cpu). Since they are better at maths than CPUs, CPUs can offload some of their maths problems onto the GPU, a bit like getting big bro to do your maths homework for you.

The best candidates are programs with high amounts of parallelisable pieces of code - [The types of parallelism|instruction-level parallelism/task parallelism](the_types_of_parallelism|instruction-level_parallelism/task_parallelism)

However, since GPUs have their own form of machine code, the CPU be speaking Portuguese (CPU machine code) to a Nigerian (GPU machine code), so there needs to be a GPU library so that the CPU can effectively talk to the GPU.
