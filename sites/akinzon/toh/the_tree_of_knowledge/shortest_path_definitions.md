The **total weight** of a path is the sum of all the edge weights from the beginning of the path to the end.

It can be generalised as this: $$w(p) = \sum_{i=1}^kw(v_{i-1},v_i) $$
The shortest path cost, $\delta$ 

$$\delta (u, v) = \begin{cases} min\ w(p)\ \text{if there is at least one path from u to v}\\ \infty\ \text {otherwise} \end{cases}$$
