The 3-Tier Architecture is a popular template employing the layered architecture.

The three layers are like this, yo:

**Presentation layer:** This is what is shown to the end-user, and also maps user input to tasks (like a button mapping to a [Methods|method](methods|method).)

**Logic layer:** This is the layer of computation, where the calculation and decision-making is done. It may need to retrieve data for processing too (like changing a user password in the database.)

**Data Layer:** This is the layer where all the data is either stored or accessed.
