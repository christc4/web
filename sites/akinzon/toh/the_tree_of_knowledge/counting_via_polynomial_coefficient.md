Polynomial expansions can be used as a method of counting.

> [!TIP]- For $a, b, c$ in $Z_+$, if $2 ≤ a ≤ 5,\ 3 ≤ b ≤ 6$ and $4 ≤ c ≤ 7$, how many solutions to $a + b + c = 17$?
> Answer: $[x^{17}](x^2 + x^3 + x^4 + x^5 )(x^3 + x^4 + x^5 + x^6 )(x^4 + x^5 + x^6 + x^7 )$
> (NOTE: Is a good way for finding the number of integer solutions)

> [!TIP]- You distribute 8 identical cookies among 3 children. Each child can receive at least 2 cookies and no more than 4 cookies. How many ways can you distribute?
> $[x^{8}](x^2 + x^3 + x^4)(x^2 + x^3 + x^4)(x^2 + x^3 + x^4)$

### Possible outcomes: Six-sided die

Polynomial for one die: 
$$ (x^1 + x^2 + x^3 + x^4 + x^5 + x^6) $$

Polynomial for two rolls:
$$  (x^1 + x^2 + x^3 + x^4 + x^5 + x^6)(x^1 + x^2 + x^3 + x^4 + x^5 + x^6) $$

All outcomes:

This can then be used to find out how many ways there are of rolling a certain number, from 1 to 12.
