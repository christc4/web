TARGET DECK

Abstraction is a way of **simplifying our understanding of the system**, by removing unnecessary details.

The simplification should
	- Focus on the system's intended purpose
	- Ignore details on how that purpose is achieved 

Whoever is abstracting a system needs to prudently judge what they decide are the system's key features.

Abstraction is the opposite of [Refinement](refinement).
