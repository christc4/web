TARGET DECK


In JUnit, Parametrised Tests allow for the tester to run tests with varying data repeatedly.

To make a parametrised test, the test data is stored in the test suite class, and the test methods are [Iteration|iteratively](iteration|iteratively) run with the set of test data.

`@ParametrizedTest` - indicates that a test is parametrised

`@ValueSource()` - represents a source of candidate test data

`@MethodSource()` - represents a source of [factory methods](factory_methods) which generate test data
