Unfortunately, RAM isn't perfect. DRAM can lose data, and permanently. 

Errors can be put into two groups - **Hard Failures** and **Soft Errors**

With **Hard Failures**, the chip is permanently damaged. Unfortunately this is the most common.

**Soft Errors**, are just random and non-destructive events that can alter the contents of a memory cell, but there is no permanent damage.

There is one saving grace though - These soft errors can be detected and fixed using **Error Correcting Code.**
