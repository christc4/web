TARGET DECK

Bubble sort is [When an Algorithm is In-place|in-place](when_an_algorithm_is_in-place|in-place)

Bubble sort is [Stability of an Algorithm|stable](stability_of_an_algorithm|stable)

In its best case, it runs in $\Theta(n)$ time, since only $n-1$ comparisons are made.

In the average and worst case, it runs in $\Theta(n^2)$ time since its comparing $n$ times, $n$ times.

But it makes TOO MANY SWAPS!!! And is therefore more expensive to execute than [Insertion Sort](insertion_sort) and [Selection Sort](selection_sort).
