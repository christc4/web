The Simplex Tableau is a convenient way of solving [linear programming problems](linear_programming_problems) using the simplex method.

[Row Operations](row_operations) are used for [Pivot Operations (Linear Programming)|Pivot Operations](pivot_operations_(linear_programming)|pivot_operations).

The variable that becomes basic is the **entering variable.**
(since it enters the left-hand side column, it looks nice and snug there)

The variable that becomes non-basic is the **leaving variable.**
