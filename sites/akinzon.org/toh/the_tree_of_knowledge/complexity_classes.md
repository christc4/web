**P** - A complexity class for decision problems (yes or no problems) for which there is an algorithm that can solve it in polynomial time.

**NP** - A class of decision problems that we can verify solutions of its instances in polynomial time.

$$ P \subseteq NP $$

**NP-Hard** - Problems as hard as NP Problems, but not necessarily NP problems themselves.

**NP-Complete** - NP-Hard problems **that are also in** the NP class
	More formally, a problem $A$ is NP-Complete if:
		$A \in NP$ 
		$\forall B \in NP \cdot B \le A$ ($B$ is either less difficult or just as difficult as $A$, $\therefore$ $A$ is $NP$-Hard)


There are two interpretations: Either $P=NP$ or $P \subset NP$.
