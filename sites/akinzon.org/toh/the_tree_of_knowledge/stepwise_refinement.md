Stepwise Refinement is the process of coming to terms with and understanding a system.

Stepwise Refinement involves taking the problem, and:
	- Simplifying it where possible (grouping similar cases, simplifying language)
	- Elaborating (decomposing the problem where needed, adding appropriate detail)

Stepwise refinement is an iterative process, and so the above steps are continuously repeated.
