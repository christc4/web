Insertion sort is [Stability of an Algorithm|stable](stability_of_an_algorithm|stable) (yay!)

Insertion sort is [When an Algorithm is In-place|in-place](when_an_algorithm_is_in-place|in-place) (W)

But it is $\Theta (n^2)$ in the average and worst case, and $\Theta(n)$ in the best case (only need to iterate through the list, making 1 comparison each time so $1 \times n = n$)

However, it is good for small arrays and decent for almost sorted arrays nonetheless
