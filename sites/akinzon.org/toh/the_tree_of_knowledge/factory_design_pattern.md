Ever needed to make different [subclasses](subclasses), or just [classes](classes) in general?
Tired of using if/else constantly?

**The Factory Design Pattern** might be for you!!! Factory methods handle the creation of classes for you:

They essentially encapsulate the creation of [objects](objects) away into a `Factory` class.

There are three main types:

[Simple Factories](simple_factories) - Just help you to create an object

[Factory Methods](factory_methods) - Allows subclasses to decide which object is created

[Abstract Factories](abstract_factories) - Allows for creating a family of related objects.

[Benefits of Factories](benefits_of_factories)

The factory design pattern encapsulates object creation into a factory class.
