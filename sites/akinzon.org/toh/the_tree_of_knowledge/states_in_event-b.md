# States in Event-B

[State Machines](state_machines) are abstract machines that model a set of states that a system or entity can be in.

[State Transitions](state_transitions) allow a system to change state.

> [!tip] Transitions can be represented by [Event-B Events|events](event-b_events|events)!

States are **partitioned,** meaning they are mutually exclusive and the [Sets|sets](sets|sets) for entities in a bunch of states are all disjoint.

Imagine having to write out all of that using set notation!! Boring, right?

This is where [The Partition Operator in Event-B|The Partition Operator](the_partition_operator_in_event-b|the_partition_operator) comes in!
