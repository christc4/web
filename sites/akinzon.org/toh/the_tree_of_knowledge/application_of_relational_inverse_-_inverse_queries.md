similar to [Application of Relational Image - Queries|normal queries](application_of_relational_image_-_queries|normal_queries) where we return the value associated with a key, we can do similar with inverse queries: We can return keys that map to a value!

In Event-B, the inverse of a relation is written as `Relation~`, where the `~` denotes that it is the inverse. 

This is useful for inverse queries, because with `Relation~[{set}]`, we can get all keys that map to values in `{set}`!
