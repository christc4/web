## YOU'RE NOT DONE I DON'T THINK (na you're done iirc did you add percolate??)

## THE OTHER GOAT. Terse.

Heaps are binary trees that satisfy two conditions:
	- [The 2 Heap Rules](the_2_heap_rules)


[Adding to Heaps](adding_to_heaps)

[Removing from Heaps](removing_from_heaps)

[Implementation of Priority Queues using Heaps](implementation_of_priority_queues_using_heaps)

[Implementing Heaps with Arrays](implementing_heaps_with_arrays)

[Time complexity of Heaps](time_complexity_of_heaps)

[Heap Sort](heap_sort)
