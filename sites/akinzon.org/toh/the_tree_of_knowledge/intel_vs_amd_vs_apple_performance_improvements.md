### Intel's "Hybrid" Architecture

Uses a mixture of cores specialised for:

 - Performance - emphasis on speed

 - Efficiency - Using/managing resources efficiently, efficiency cores don't have big execution units or big micro-op caches as those emphasise performance

### AMD - Intel's Big bro or Lil bro?

Can beat Intel on Instructions Per clock
128 PCIe 5.0 lanes
12 memory channels on some chips (more communication with [Cache](cache) and [RAM](ram))

### Apple, the Big Bad... Chip?

Uses [ARM](arm)'s "Big-Little" architecture 

Has fast Performance cores and power-efficient Efficiency cores

Has a smarter scheduler (heh, nerd)

3nm process - smaller than the competitors - allows for the chips to be tiny, and so use less power or to have more chips available
