TARGET DECK

Relation schemas ($R(A_1,A_2,…,A_k)$) contain the name of the relation (replaces $R$) and an ordered sequence of $k$ attributes (this is the $(A_1,A_2,…,A_k)$)

`Student(ID, name)` is an example of a relation schema

These schema form a **blueprint** that its elements (the [k-ary Relations|relations](k-ary_relations|relations) themselves) must follow.

Therefore, all relations that could be called instances of such a schema are its **instances**.

In [database management systems](database_management_systems), these schema can also define the types for each attribute.
