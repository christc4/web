# Decision Trees and Time Complexity

TARGET DECK

For decision trees, the time taken to finish a task is the [Levels and Height of a Tree|depth](levels_and_height_of_a_tree|depth) of the tree at the leaf we're on.

Decision trees themselves can be used to determine the time complexity:
	- **Worst Case:** Depth of deepest leaf.
	- **Best Case:** Depth of shallowest leaf.
	- **Average Case:** Average depth of leaves
