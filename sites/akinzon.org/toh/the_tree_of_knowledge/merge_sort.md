TARGET DECK

The Merge Sort is an example of a sorting algorithm that employs **divide-and-conquer:** it splits the list into halves [Recursion|recursively](recursion|recursively), until it is only singleton sublists, or reaches a point where [insertion sort](insertion_sort) is faster and sorts those sublists.


These sublists are then merged together to form the final sorted list.
