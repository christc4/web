[Counting Sort Algorithm](counting_sort_algorithm)

This algorithm essentially uses the amount of times values appear in the unsorted array + a cumulative count to sort them.

This algorithm is [Stability of an Algorithm|stable](stability_of_an_algorithm|stable) (nice)

But this algorithm is not [When an Algorithm is In-place|in-place](when_an_algorithm_is_in-place|in-place) because it requires a new array to represent the sorted output.

This algorithm is $O(n + k)$, and is pure $O(n)$ when $n$ dominates $k$.
