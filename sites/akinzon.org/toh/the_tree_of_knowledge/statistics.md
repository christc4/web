TARGET DECK

The whole point of statistics is to be able to make inferences using sample data and operations performed on that data.

. . .But it isn't perfect.

[Probability Distribution Functions](probability_distribution_functions)

[Expected Values](expected_values)

[Variance](variance)

[Covariance](covariance) and [Correlation](correlation) can be used to study the probabilistic relationship between $X$ and $Y$. It is important to note that:
$$ correlation \neq causation $$

I did not expand the expression for Y properly, and I failed to realise that $\mathbb{E}[X^2]$ is **NOT THE SAME AS** $(\mathbb{E}[X])^2$

I also couldn't recall the formula for [Variance](variance)

I didn't use the unbiased variance estimator $$ \frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{x=1}^i(y-\bar{y})^2 $$
To get a more accurate value for the variance, since it was unknown. (OR JUST USE THE VALUE $sx$) IN YOUR CALCLULATORRRR)

The question is bugged, but I used a wrong variance estimator value anyway, and couldn't recall that the p-value expression for a 2-tailed test would be:
$$ p = 2\mathbb{P}(Z < |z|) = \frac{\bar{y} - \mu_{guess}}{(\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}})}  $$
