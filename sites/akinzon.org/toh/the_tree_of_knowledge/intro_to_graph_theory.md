^ Just so you know the difference

Graphs are useful for modelling connectivity, the connections different things share with each other.

[Sets](sets), [Linear Algebra](linear_algebra), and [Combinatorics](combinatorics) can be used to describe graphs.

Graphs can have **isomorphism:** How they are named doesn't matter, how the lines are drawn doesn't matter, the only thing that matters is **how the nodes connect.**

These three graphs are the same, and can even be mapped to each other by [functions](functions).
