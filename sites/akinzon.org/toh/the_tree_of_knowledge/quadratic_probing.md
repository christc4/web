# Quadratic Probing

Quadratic probing involves checking every square number of positions after the address that was hashed to.

$$ h(x) + d \in \{1,4,9,...\} $$

This somewhat prevents clustering since values aren't just placed one after each other in the event of collisions.

However, it's almost like a game of roulette, you have to get lucky to find a space! You might never find one.
