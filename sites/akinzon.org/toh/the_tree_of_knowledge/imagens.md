Hello! I am looking for someone to take over my tenancy for the 6-bedroom 57 Avenue Road, Portswood, SO14 6TW.

It's about a 26-minute walk from Southampton University Highfield campus, 15-minute walk from Avenue Campus, and it's a 20-minute walk from Solent University.

The house has good parking space, back garden, bathroom, kitchen space and it's a spacious house, too. You can move in from July 1st! Rent is £126 (Base price £103 + bills included), and I'd be willing to pay the initial deposit for you as well. DM if interested!
