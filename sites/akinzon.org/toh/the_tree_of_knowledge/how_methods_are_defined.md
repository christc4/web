> the 'static' keyword is optional.

methods can be `public`, `private` or `protected` (or `default`?)

methods don't need to be `static`

methods must have a return type, which can be either [Primitives](primitives) or [Classes](classes), and if you want to return nothing, the corresponding return type is `void`. 

In other words, if a method has a `return` statement, it is not `void`.

must place brackets after a method definition `()`, this is where parameters go.

methods, just like [variables](variables), must start with lowercase letters.
