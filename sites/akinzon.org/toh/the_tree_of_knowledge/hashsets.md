HashSets are Java's implementation of [Sets (ADT)|sets](sets_(adt)|sets) using hash tables as the data structure.

They are [Asymptotic Notation|asymptotically](asymptotic_notation|asymptotically) superior to [TreeSets](treesets) with $O(1)$ speed on operations rather than the $O(log (n))$ of TreeSets.

It's not as crazy as you think though, since it can take time to compute each hash address.

HashSets do not return elements in order whereas TreeSets do.
