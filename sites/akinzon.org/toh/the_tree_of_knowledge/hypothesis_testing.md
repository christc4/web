### Definitions
**Point estimation** - outputting a single number to describe a dataset (such as an estimator for the mean)

**Confidence interval** - Give range of plausible values for the unknown population parameter

### Null and alternative hypothesis

**Null hypothesis $H_0$ :**
This is the default position, such as "innocent until proven guilty"

**Alternative hypothesis $H_A$ :**
A statement that goes against the null hypothesis 

With hypothesis testing, we are asking how likely it is for y to happen given $H_0$

If this is below a certain confidence interval, we reject $H_0$.
