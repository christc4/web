**Hyperplanes** are a subspace whose dimension is 1 less the dimension it sits in
	For example, a hyperplane in 2d space is a line
A hyper-plane is represented by a linear equation

With multiple linear equations, you can get intersecting hyperplanes

Three different cases:
	- Lines cross at a single point: One set of solutions
	- Lines are parallel but no overlap: No solutions
	- Lines are parallel and overlap: Infinitely many solutions.
