Planes can be defined as a dot product between $\overrightarrow n$, a point at a 90$\degree$ angle with the plane, and ($\overrightarrow r$ - $\overrightarrow r_0$), where $\overrightarrow r_0$ is a point on the plane, and the dot product is 0 (dot product of 0 = $\overrightarrow n$ is indeed orthogonal to the plane.)
This can otherwise be written as:
$$ \langle \overrightarrow n,  (\overrightarrow r - \overrightarrow r_0)\rangle = 0$$
