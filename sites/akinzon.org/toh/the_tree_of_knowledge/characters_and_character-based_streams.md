Characters are 2 bytes long (16-bit [Unicode](unicode)), and so character-based streams will be writing/reading 2 bytes whenever a character is [Character-Based Writer Stream Example|written](character-based_writer_stream_example|written) or [Character-Based Reader Stream Example|read](character-based_reader_stream_example|read).

However, these characters are encoded/decoded according to specific supported character encodings, with the most popular one being [UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8).
