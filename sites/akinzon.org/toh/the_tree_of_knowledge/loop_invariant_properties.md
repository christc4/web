For a property to be a loop invariant, we must be able to show these three things:
	- **Initialisation:** The loop invariant holds true before the loop
	- **Maintenance:** If is true before any iteration, it must also hold true before the next iteration.
	- **Termination:** When the loop ends, the invariant should be able to give us a useful property that helps us to prove algorithm correctness.
