The **running time** of an algorithm is the number of steps it takes, or **primitive operations** (add, subtract, assignment, etc.) executed by an algorithm.

Counting these operations can give a good estimate to the running time of an algorithm, as they all take some time, which adds up.

Some may take more time than others, so we can assign a **cost** to each operation, like so:

A lot of the time, we may want to consider the [Time Complexity of an Algorithm](time_complexity_of_an_algorithm).
