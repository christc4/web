# Cuts in Graph Theory

For a graph $G$, its **cut** would be a **partition** of the graph's vertices into two disjoint [sets](sets), $S$ and $V - S$.

Edges $(u, v) \in E$ can **cross the cut** if $u$ was in $S$ and $v$ was in $V - S$, or the other way around.

Cuts **respect** a set $A \subseteq E$ if no edge in $A$ cross the cut.
