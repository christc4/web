TARGET DECK

A formula $\phi$ is in canonical normal form if and only if it is a [Propositional Formulae|conjunction](propositional_formulae|conjunction) of clauses each containing disjunctions.

For example: 

$$ (x_1 \lor x_2 \lor \bar x_3) \land (\bar x_2) \land (x_3 \lor \bar x_4) $$
Is in canonical normal form since it is a conjunction of disjunctions.
