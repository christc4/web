Java is very kind and has implemented **autoboxing** so that primitives are automatically cast to objects and **unboxing** so that objects can be reverted back to primitives where necessary. How cool?

What is meant by [Autoboxing and Unboxing](autoboxing_and_unboxing)? #flashcard 
Autoboxing is the automatic process of Java wrapping [Primitives](primitives) in [Objects](objects), and unboxing is when objects are 'unzipped' back to the underlying primitive.
