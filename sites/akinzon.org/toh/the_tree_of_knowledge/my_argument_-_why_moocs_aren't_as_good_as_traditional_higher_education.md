# My argument - why MOOCs aren't as good as traditional higher education

Up: [Professional development coursework](professional_development_coursework)

	Each slide should convey 1 idea

#### Slide 1: retention issues <-> low completion rates

	 "As many as half" of students who sign up for MOOCs "do not enter the course post-registration."
	(Leonard, W., 2019. So why did MOOCs fail to live up to the hype?.Â _University World News_.)
	
What does this mean? Why could this be the case?
	"low-cost, MOOC-based degrees" are more appealing to "students from low-income families, and underrepresented minorities" ([References#^3fab7a|3](references#^3fab7a|3)) who won't be able to afford the high cost of university, but aren't as deterred by the cost of MOOCs, and the promise of a degree at the end of it. 

#### Slide 2: The issue of appealing to the underrepresented

There is an issue with appealing to underrepresented minorities ([References#^c4e8f2|2](references#^c4e8f2|2)) , and it is that they are also the most likely to be "the kinds of students who have historically been poorly served by online degree programs" ([References#^3fab7a|3](references#^3fab7a|3)) , 

*which could be another answer to the question of low retention/completion rates: Many students simply do not work well in an online setting.

As per the graph, schools with the most free school meals-eligible students struggled to cover as much content as schools with fewer free school meals students

MOOCs with cohorts of "students from low-income families, and underrepresented minorities" are analogous to such schools

 *The lack of face-to-face learning also impacts these people the most since they also gain the most benefit from physical 1-on-1 clarification from a teacher, which isn't always readily available from a MOOC. Consequently, this struggle to cover content and the lack of clarification over tough topics presents itself as a low retention rate, since it is easier to drop out of an online course that you're signed up for than with mandatory education.

It is even clear that in-person support is more conducive to learning for underrepresented minorities than an online approach ([References#^5b2d8f|5](references#^5b2d8f|5)), and despite its allure of being a cheaper approach, MOOCs fail to provide ample support for those most in need.
