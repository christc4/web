A vector space over the real numbers R is simply a non-empty [sets|set](sets|set) V containing the two binary operations (Vector addition, scalar multiplication), and these operations satisfy the following conditions:
	 - Associativity of vector addition: u+(v + w)=(u + v)+w
	 - Commutativity of vector addition: u + v=v + u
	 - Identity element: exists 0 in V, such that v+0=v
	 - Inverse element: for all v exists (-v) in V such that v+(-v)=0
	 - For all a, b in R and v in V: a(b\*v)=(ab)\*v
	 - Identity element of scalar multiplication: 1\*v=v
	 - Distributivity of scalar multiplication vs vector add: a*(u + v)= a\*v + b\*v
	 - Distributivity of scalar mult vs field add: (a+b)\*v = a\*v + b\*v
