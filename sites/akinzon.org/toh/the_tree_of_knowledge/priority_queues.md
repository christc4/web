TARGET DECK

Similar to regular queues, priority queues assign a priority to enqueued items, and so the queue is split up into subqueues of differing priorities.

Items with a higher priority get dequeued first.

Methods:
 - `insert(T elem, int priority)` - inserts item into the subqueue with the priority value `priority`.
 - `findMin()` - same as `peek()`, checks what is at the front of the queue.
 - `deleteMin()` - `dequeue()`s the item at the front of the queue.
 - `isEmpty()` of course
