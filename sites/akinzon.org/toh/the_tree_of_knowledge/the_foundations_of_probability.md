### The Sample Space
This is the [sets|set](sets|set) of all possible outcomes, denoted by Ω.
	Ω can never be empty (Ω $\neq$ ∅)

For example, the sample space of tossing a coin is:
$$ \{H, \ T\} $$
With $H$ representing heads, and $T$ representing tails.

### Events
Subsets of the sample space Ω are called **events**, denoted by $E$.
	$E ⊂ Ω$ - An event is a subset of a sample space
	$Ω = \cup E$ - The sample space is the union of all events.

### Classical Probability
The classical probability of $\mathbb{P}(E)$ an event $E$ is defined as:
$$ \mathbb{P}(E) = \frac{|E|}{|Ω|} $$
$|E|$ - how many ways $E$ can happen
$|Ω|$ - total cardinality of the sample space
