What is the difference between [UML Static Diagrams|static diagrams](uml_static_diagrams|static_diagrams) and [UML Dynamic Diagrams|dynamic diagrams](uml_dynamic_diagrams|dynamic_diagrams)? #flashcard 
Static diagrams convey the system's structure and what it contains, while dynamic diagrams convey the system's flow and what it does.

What are the two differences between [Activity Diagrams](activity_diagrams) vs [Use Case Diagrams](use_case_diagrams)? #flashcard 
Activity diagrams show how different activities follow and flow from each other, while use case diagrams show how the user may interact with the system.
Activity diagrams have an order, but use case diagrams do not.

What is the difference between [Activity Diagrams](activity_diagrams) and [State Machine Diagrams](state_machine_diagrams)? #flashcard 
Activity diagrams detail what the system does, whereas state machine diagrams detail the states that parts of the system can take.

Why do we need [State Machine Diagrams](state_machine_diagrams)? #flashcard 
State machine diagrams allow us to be sure that the system has no **unexpected behaviour**: We should be able to know the state of the system at all times.
