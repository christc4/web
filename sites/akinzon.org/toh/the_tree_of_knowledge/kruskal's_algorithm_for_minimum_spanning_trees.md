Kruskal's algorithm is **edge-based.**

Kruskal's algorithm for finding minimum spanning trees works by:
	- Each edge has an associated weight/cost.
	- Starting at one node
	- Adding an edge every iteration:
		- By ascending order of weight
		- **IF** it does not create a cycle
	- Stopping when there are no more edges to check
