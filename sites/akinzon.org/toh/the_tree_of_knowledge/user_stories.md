TARGET DECK

User stories are a short description of what the [System Actors|actor](system_actors|actor) expects to gain from using the system.

These have a nice template:

As an `<actor>` I want to `<action>` so that `<something is achieved>`

As an `<actor>`, if `<context>` when `<event/action>` then `<system action>`

They are used a lot in the [AGILE Approach](agile_approach), and some even consider them as an alternative to [functional requirements](functional_requirements)

These are only to describe interactions **WITH USERS,** for other systems, other documents are used.
