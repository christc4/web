TARGET DECK

Hyperthreading is when one core pretends to be two different cores so that it can fetch/decode multiple instructions, but at the same time all these 'virtual cores' share execution units and cache.

Benefit - gives a slight speed boost, not as much as [Multi-core CPUs|more cores](multi-core_cpus|more_cores)

Main goal - keeps the execution units busier, so that processor time is not wasted.
