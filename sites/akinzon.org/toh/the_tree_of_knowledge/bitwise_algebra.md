#### Binary Addition

0 + 0 = 1
1 + 0 = 1
1 + 1 = 0 carry 1
1 + 1 + 1 = 1 carry 1

Implemented using half adder/full adder

Half adder has no $C_{in}$ or $C_{out}$ for carry bits but full adder does.

$XOR$ inputs for sum, $AND$ inputs for carry bit

#### Binary Subtraction

Convert 2nd number into two's complement negative number and add, ignore final carry bit

#### Binary Multiplication

You're either multiplying the first number by 1, 10, or powers of 10, then add all the products together.
