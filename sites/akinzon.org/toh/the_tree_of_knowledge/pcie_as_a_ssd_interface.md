Since SATA SSDs are slow AF (600MB/s), NVMe (Nonvolatile Memory express) in an M.2 (M.2 LITERALLY just means it looks like a pack of chewing gum) format attached to PCIe lanes
	> This is fast (2GB/s)
	> It also supports long command queues

What is NVMe [Solid State Drives|SSD](solid_state_drives|ssd)? Why is it faster than SATA SSD? #flashcard 
Nonvolatile Memory express is a type of storage interface, and is faster than [SATA](sata) because it uses [PCIe](pcie) lanes.

What are the typical continuous Read rates of a [SATA](sata) [Solid State Drives|SSD](solid_state_drives|ssd) and a NVME M.2 SSD? #flashcard 
SATA - 600MB/s
NVMe - 2GB/s (just remember the PCIe speeds)
