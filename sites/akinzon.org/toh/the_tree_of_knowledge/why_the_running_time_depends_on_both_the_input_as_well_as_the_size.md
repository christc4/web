# Why The running time depends on both the input as well as the size

The running time of an algorithm depends also on the input itself because how it is structured/ordered can result in a best case/worst case running time.

Take this example:

The best-case for this algorithm would be for the if statement to never be fulfilled (if `A[1]` is the smallest number), because it results in fewer operations being done.

The worst-case would be if the if statement was always fulfilled (`A[i]` always less than m), because then we need to update the value of `m` each time.
