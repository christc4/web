### THE FOUR HORSEMEN OF INSTRUCTION SET ARCHITECTURE

[Accumulator based architecture](accumulator_based_architecture)

[Stack based architecture](stack_based_architecture)

[Register to memory architecture](register_to_memory_architecture)

[Register to register architecture](register_to_register_architecture)

â€¦ For each of these, consider the operation X = A + B.

There is also the lil bozo called [Memory to memory architecture](memory_to_memory_architecture). He's a bum though.

^ Gives an overview/layout of the number of operands and memory addresses used in each type of architecture.

Are more registers better? see:
