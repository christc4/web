This architecture is functionally similar to [Register to memory architecture](register_to_memory_architecture) but the value B is also loaded into a register.

Benefits - Fast, simple code generation, consistent number of cycles per instruction, fast access to temporary values

Disadvantages - Needs much more instructions (Sounds quite [RISC](risc)y, eh?)

How does register-register architecture work, give an advantage and  a disadvantage #flashcard 
In [Register to register architecture](register_to_register_architecture), operands are loaded into registers before any operations are carried out
It results in simpler code generation, but it results in programs with much more instructions.
