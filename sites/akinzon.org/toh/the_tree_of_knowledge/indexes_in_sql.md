# Indexes in SQL

TARGET DECK

Indexes are [Data Structures](data_structures) that are associated with a table to increase the speed of querying.

They are ordered according to the values of each key of each record in that table.

**The key benefit:** They make it possible to query large tables in better than $O(n)$ time! Much faster lookup under the hood.

But you have to update the index for all entries, however.

> [!tip] Think of it as making a record of (**indexing**) each table entry based on a specific attribute.
