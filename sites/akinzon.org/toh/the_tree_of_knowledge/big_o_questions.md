What does it mean for $f(n) = O(g(n))$ (normal and mathematical definition) #flashcard 
It means $g(n)$ is an asymptotic upper bound for $f(n)$, that $f(n)$ can run no higher than $c \cdot g(n)$ for some constant $c$.   
It means that we can find a constant $d$ and an $n_0$ 
such that $0 \le f(n) \le dg(n)$ for all $n \ge n_0$.
