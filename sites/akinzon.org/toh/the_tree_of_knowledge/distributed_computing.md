**Distributed computing** is when you contribute your clock cycles, typically used to allow for simulations to run for medical research or climate models.

It works quite well since little data is being sent to and fro, so bandwidth isn't an issue.

What is distributed computing? #flashcard 
[Distributed computing](distributed_computing) is when you donate your spare clock cycles to be used by someone else, typically to run simulations or models.
