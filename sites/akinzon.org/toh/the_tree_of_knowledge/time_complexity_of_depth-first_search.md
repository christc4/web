Depth-First search is rather similar to [Time Complexity of Breadth-First Search|Breadth-First Search](time_complexity_of_breadth-first_search|breadth-first_search) in time complexity.

It has a bunch of $\Theta(1)$ operations that all run $V$ times, and a bunch of operations that run `adj[u]` times, with $V \cdot adj(u) = O(|E|)$.

Overall, the time complexity is $O(|V| + |E|)$.
