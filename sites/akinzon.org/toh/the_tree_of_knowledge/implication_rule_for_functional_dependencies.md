# Implication Rule for Functional Dependencies

This is the idea that a Functional dependency $A \rightarrow B$ follows/logically implies from a [Sets|set](sets|set) of FDs, $S$.

This is written as:
## $$ S ⊧ A \rightarrow B  $$

This is true if every instance of a relation that satisfies all the FDs in $S$ also satisfies $A \rightarrow B$. 

For sets $S$, $T$ we would write $S ⊧ T$ if $\forall t \in T,\ \ S ⊧ t.$
