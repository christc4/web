TARGET DECK

Dynamic Programming is good in problems where:
	- The substructure is **optimal:** This means that the problem can easily be broken down into subproblems, and that a [Recurrence Relations|recurrence relation](recurrence_relations|recurrence_relation) can be formed between a problem and its subproblems.
	- The subproblems **overlap:** This means that the solution to a subproblem can be used to solve a larger problem, otherwise it is no different to classic divide-and-conquer.

Since subproblems have an overlap, we will definitely want to use the solution to subproblems to solve other problems. 

This is done through [Memoisation](memoisation) or through [Bottom-Up Solutions](bottom-up_solutions).
