This is mainly transferring data between the [The Processor|CPU](the_processor|cpu) and [RAM|memory](ram|memory)

This can be done by a separate using **DMA (Direct Memory Access)**, which is faster as the data does not need to pass through the ALU.

This can be done using data movement instructions, known as Memory-mapped I/O.
