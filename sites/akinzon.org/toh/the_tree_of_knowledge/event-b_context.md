[Carrier Sets|Carrier sets](carrier_sets|carrier_sets) used by the machine are placed in a **context**.

A context represents the static part of the system/model.

Machines use the keyword `sees` to make use of a context.

The context contains:
	 - **Constants:** variables whose value is never changed
	 - **Axioms:** constraints on the constants, similar to invariants.
