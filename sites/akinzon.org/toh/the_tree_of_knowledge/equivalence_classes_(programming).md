TARGET DECK

In the same way in Set theory that Equivalence classes of a set are [sets](sets) where all elements are from the same set and have an equivalence relation between each other, equivalence classes in programming are a set of values who yield an equivalent result.

> [!tip]- Find the equivalence classes in this example: “A theme park is testing a new ticketing system. Adults aged 18 or over pay £20, children aged 5 years or younger get in free, and other children pay £12. In all cases, if the person is a member of the theme park fan club the cost is reduced by 50%.”
> Adults - 18 and above
> Children - 5 and below
> Other children - 6-17
> $\{Theme\ park\ members\,\ Non\ members\} \times \{Adults,\ Young\ children,\ Older\ children\}$
