Given the [General Recursion Recurrence Format](general_recursion_recurrence_format), The Master Method helps us to calculate the time complexity of divide-and-conquer recursive algorithms.

The method is as follows:
$$ T(n) = \begin{cases} 
O(n^dlog\ n) (\text{if}\ a = b^d)\\
O(n^d) (\text{if}\ a \lt b^d)\\
O(n^{log_ba}) (\text{if}\ a \gt b^d)\\


\end{cases} $$
