^ Sukuna's slash was uncountably infinite and Gojo's infinity was countable

## Not all infinities are created equal. 

**Countably infinite** - Can be [Counting via Bijection|counted bijectively](counting_via_bijection|counted_bijectively) using the Natural numbers $\mathbb{N}$

**Uncountably infinite** - Cannot be counted using the Natural numbers, and is bijective to the Real numbers $\mathbb{R}$ instead.

Sets can be proven to be uncountably infinite using [Diagonalisation](diagonalisation).
