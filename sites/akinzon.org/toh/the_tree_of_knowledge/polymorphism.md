[Collections and Inheritance|Substitution](collections_and_inheritance|substitution) + [Overriding](overriding) + [Dynamic Binding](dynamic_binding) = **Polymorphism!!**

#### What the heck does this mean???

With polymorphism, we can create [methods](methods) that take [superclasses](superclasses) as parameters and:
	- Pass them instances of [subclasses](subclasses) (substitution)
	- When these methods call a subclass' method if the subclass has a more specific version of a method (via overriding) then the subclass' method is called instead of the superclass (dynamic binding)

What the heck is [polymorphism](polymorphism) #flashcard 
Polymorphism is when we can create [methods](methods) that take [Superclasses](superclasses) as parameters, but pass them its [subclasses](subclasses), and use the functionality of the subclass' specific version of inherited methods where possible via [Dynamic Binding](dynamic_binding).
