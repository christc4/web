The conditional probability is the probability of one variable being one value on the **condition** that another variable is a particular value.

When calculating conditional probability, you **reduce the sample space** to the marginal probability for the conditional variable.

As a result, the outcome we are looking for must be joint with that conditional variable. This is why people say:
$$ conditional = \frac{joint}{marginal}$$
For example, $\mathbb{P}(X=1|Y=1) = \frac{\mathbb{P}(X=1,Y=1)}{\mathbb{P}(Y=1)} = \frac{0.05}{0.05+0.15+0.1}=\frac{0.05}{0.3}=\frac{1}{6}$
