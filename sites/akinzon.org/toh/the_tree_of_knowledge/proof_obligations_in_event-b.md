In Event-B, Proof Obligations are mathematical theorems that come from a formal model.

Proof obligations can be used to verify model properties like if [Event-B Invariants|invariants](event-b_invariants|invariants) are being preserved.

Proof obligations work by using deductive [Logic|logic](logic|logic) and [Sets|set theory](sets|set_theory).
