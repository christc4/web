TARGET DECK

If there are $n$ pigeons and $m$ pigeonholes, and $n > m$, then there will be a pigeonhole with more than 1 pigeon.![Pasted image 20240103172249.png](pasted_image_20240103172249.png)


**Pigeonhole principle formula**
To find the number of pigeons in the overfilled pigeonhole:
$$ \lfloor (n-1)/m \rfloor + 1  $$
Where $n$ is the number of total pigeons, and $m$ is the number of pigeonholes.


> [!TIP]- **Example:** 13 friends, prove that there are at least two of them born on the same month. 
> Exact pigeonhole principle application:
> There are 12 months, and 13 friends, so:
> $\lfloor (13-1)/12 \rfloor + 1  = 2$
