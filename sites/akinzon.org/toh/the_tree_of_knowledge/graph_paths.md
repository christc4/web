A **path** is a sequence of vertices such that you can go from one vertex to another.

Formally, this is represented as:
$$ \forall w_i,w_{i+1} \in \{w_1...w_n\}: (w_i, w_i+1) \in E $$

The **length** of a path is the number of edges in it.

Paths are **simple** if all vertices except for the first and last, are distinct.

A **cycle** is a path such that the first vertex in the path is also the last.

For undirected graphs, each edge must be distinct for a cycle to exist. (Why is this the case?)

Graphs are **acyclic** if they contain no cycles (like [trees](trees))

Graphs are connected if there is a path from every vertex to every other vertex.
