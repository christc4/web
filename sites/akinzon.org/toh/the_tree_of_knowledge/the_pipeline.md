# The Pipeline

Up: [Pipelining, Parallelisation and superscalar architecture](pipelining,_parallelisation_and_superscalar_architecture)
Brother: [Superscalar architecture](superscalar_architecture)

A pipeline divides **instruction execution** into many parallelised parts,  
and some of these parts can prefetch an instruction in order to alleviate  
the bottleneck of [Instruction cycle|fetching](instruction_cycle|fetching) instructions.

Pipelines allow one instruction to be completed per clock cycle
