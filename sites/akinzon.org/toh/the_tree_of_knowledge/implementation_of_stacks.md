Maybe implemented using [data structures](data_structures) such as [arrays](arrays) or [Linked Lists](linked_lists)

When implemented with linked lists, stack operations take $\Theta (1)$ time.

Of course, you're going to need $\Theta (n)$ space, since each node stores the reference to its next node, and there are $n$ nodes to store.

Arrays are typically better for stacks.

Why are [Arrays (Algorithmics)|arrays](arrays_(algorithmics)|arrays) better than [Linked Lists](linked_lists) for implementing [stacks](stacks)? #flashcard 
Arrays are typically better for stacks because they do not have the [RAM|memory](ram|memory) cost of creating/storing/destroying objects that linked lists do.
