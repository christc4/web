Similar to the [The Job Scheduling Algorithm](the_job_scheduling_algorithm), the Fractional Knapsack Algorithm uses the ratio of value to weight to take as many items with the best `value:weight` ratio as possible, and when there isn't enough to take the full amount of an item, the highest possible fraction (total amount / remaining space) is taken instead.

For a 0-1 knapsack, you cannot take a fraction of an item, so if a whole item cannot be taken, a smaller item is considered instead.
