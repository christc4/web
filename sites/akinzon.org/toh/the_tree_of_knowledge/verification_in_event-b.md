TARGET DECK

There are 3 types of verification in Event-B:
	 - **Model verification:** How correct and internally consistent  a model is
		- How well it maintains [Event-B Invariants|invariants](event-b_invariants|invariants)
		- How well it [Refinement in Event-B|refines](refinement_in_event-b|refines) another model
	 - **Formal verification:** Proving or disproving the correctness of a formal model given some *anticipated properties* in a mathematical way.
	 - **Code verification:** How well a program implements a spec/model
