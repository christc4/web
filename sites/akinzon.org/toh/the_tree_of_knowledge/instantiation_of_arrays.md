**Instantiating arrays:**

```java
numbers = new int[9]; // 9 represents the length
```

Array indexing typically starts at 0. The 9-length array above has array indices `0-8`.

You can reference a specific array index and use it

```java
numbers[2] = 3; // the number in the 3rd posiiton is now 3.
```
