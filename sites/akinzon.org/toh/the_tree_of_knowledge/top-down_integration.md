Top-down integration is an integration test strategy.

This is the strategy:
	- Test the [High-Level Modules|high-level modules](high-level_modules|high-level_modules) in [Testing in Isolation|isolation](testing_in_isolation|isolation)
	- Add in the modules that the high-level module calls ([Low-Level Modules|low-level modules](low-level_modules|low-level_modules)) and test them together
	- Repeat the above two steps until the lowest-level modules are reached
