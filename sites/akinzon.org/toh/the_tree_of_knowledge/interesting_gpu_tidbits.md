**Not all GPUs produce a graphical output**, some are only used for their superior mathematical computing power (Datacentre cards, Nvidia H100)

**Some tablet [System on a Chip](system_on_a_chip) designs have GPUs:** Qualcomm SoC, for example

**Nvidia GPUs may be used in Self-Driving cars**, 

**GPUs are SIMD powerhouses**, and excel at performing the same operation on multiple items of data at the same time.

When might a GPU be used with no regard for its image output? #flashcard 
Datacentre cards only make use of a GPU's superior mathematics power
