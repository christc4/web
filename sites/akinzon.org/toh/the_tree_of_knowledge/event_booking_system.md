TARGET DECK


```
Design an event ticket system for buying tickets for events. These events can be held at a selection of venues. These tickets also have different tiers, based on the location + quality of the seating within the venue. Customers are able to select the different tier of ticket they want, but there are a finite amount of these tickets per venue, so they should not have the option to buy out-of-sale tickets. Customers can also select the seat they want, although obviously they won't be able to select a seat that has already been taken. Tickets are bought online, so you don't need to worry about modelling cash. The company who runs this ticketing service have an event coordinator who has the ability to add and remove events. 

Events consist of a venue, a date, and an act (who is performing).
Venues consist of a location, number of available seats, and opening times.
Tickets consist of a tier, a seat number, the venue they're at, a price, and the event they're for.

Since people are going online to buy these tickets, there are also Users to buy these tickets, with a name and email. 
Users, when buying, can see their basket of tickets, and also a receipt for these tickets once bought
