#### I am doing coursework 4, this is the brief:
![Pasted image 20231104074253.png](pasted_image_20231104074253.png)
#### It makes sense that I will need to consider:
	- The extent to which we are protected by freedom of speech (researching laws)
	- The extent to which we are protected by defamation laws (researching laws)
	- How the technicalities of these laws interact with each other, and how this looks like in the real world (given examples)
	- Point out what responsibilities individuals have as well as organisations pertaining to upholding both laws
	- Find the fine line between free speech and defamation
	- Find out ways in which website/blog owners are bound to make sure that their sites are protected from hackers who may choose to use the website to publish their own 'rogue' views and messages
	- Find out how these site owners can make use of technical and non-technical solutions to make it easier to protect their site.
	- Keep it within a UK context

#### What would it mean for me to provide an introduction to the freedom of speech and defamation??

It could mean: 
	1. Giving a history of both laws (from a UK context)
	2. Showing the evolution of both laws (from a UK context)
	3. The laws in their current form today (from a UK context)
	4. The freedom of speech laws only serve to highlight why regulation (defamation) needed, to bring the society closer to the centre between pure legalism and antinomianism. 


#### TODO:

I gotta:
	1. Use a few more online examples, it is a comp sci report after all
	2. maybe go in-depth on defamation and free speech, describe in more detail
	3. Refer to defamation act 2013
