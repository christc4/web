If $det(A) â‰  0$ then $A^{-1}$ exists and the columns of said matrix are linearly independent

$1 = det(I) = det(AA^{-1})$ (1)

Since (1), 

$1 = det(I) = det(A)det(A^{-1})$

$det(A^{-1}) = 1/det(A)$

Swapping rows in a matrix changes the sign of the determinant

Adding one row to another keeps the same determinant

A matrix B that is the result of a matrix X multiplied by a scalar x has a determinant B = $x det(A)$ 

$det(AB) = det(A)det(B)$ (2)

Since (2),

$det(A^5) = (det(A))^5$
