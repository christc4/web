Variable names are case-sensitive - username != userName.

Variable names can contain letters, numbers, " _ " and " $ "

BUT they CANNOT start numbers and capital letters (capital letters are reserved for [Classes](classes))

To avoid any trouble, don't use reserved words (such as class, public, true, and so on.)

It is conventional to have variable names that convey what they contain (width would be preferred to w.)
