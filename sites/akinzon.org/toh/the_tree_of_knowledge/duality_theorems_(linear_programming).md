**Weak Duality Theorem:** If LP1 is [Unbounded Feasible Regions|unbounded](unbounded_feasible_regions|unbounded) then LP2 is infeasible, and vice versa.
If LP1 is infeasible then LP2 is either unbounded or infeasible, and vice versa.
If both LP1 and LP2 are bounded and feasible then: 
$$ opt(LP1) \le opt (LP2) $$


**Strong Duality Theorem:** If either LP1 or LP2 is bounded and feasible then so is the other, and so we have: 
$$ opt(LP1) = opt(LP2) $$
