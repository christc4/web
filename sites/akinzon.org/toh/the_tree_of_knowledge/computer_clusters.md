**Computer Clusters** are a bunch of computers sharing a high-speed [Interconnections in a Computer System|interconnect](interconnections_in_a_computer_system|interconnect) in order to solve tasks.

Software must be written specifically for cluster computing.

Furthermore, the [Networks|network](networks|network) must be (incredibly) fast, with insane bandwidth (such as using InfiniBand, which can get you 300gbps) otherwise it becomes a bottleneck

What are computer clusters? #flashcard 
[Computer Clusters](computer_clusters) are a group of computers joined by a high-speed [Interconnections in a Computer System|interconnect](interconnections_in_a_computer_system|interconnect) to increase computation power.
