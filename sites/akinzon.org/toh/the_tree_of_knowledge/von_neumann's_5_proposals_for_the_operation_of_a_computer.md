# von Neumann's 5 proposals for the operation of a computer

Up: [Basic Concepts and History of the Computer](basic_concepts_and_history_of_the_computer)

1)The device should have the ability to perform elementary arithmetic operations using a _centralised arithmetic_ unit  
  
2)An operation's sequence must be moderated by a "control unit". For the device to be general-purpose, a distinction should  
be drawn between the program's instructions and the control instructions used to execute a program.  
  
3)Any device that has to execute long operations/calculations needs sufficient memory to store all the relevant data  
  
4)The device must have the ability to capture data from its [von Neumann's Recording Medium|recording medium](von_neumann's_recording_medium|recording_medium) to be sent to the main memory and CPU  
  
5)The device must have the ability to **output data** from the main memory and CPU to the recording medium.
