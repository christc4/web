### Γ ⊦ $φ$ implies Γ ⊧ $φ$ - Soundness

Whenever the assumptions in Γ prove $φ$, they also semantically entail it.

If a rule in our proof system can prove a statement, then it is true and the rule is sound.

Natural deduction is sound and complete, but taking away any rule does not affect soundness since the remaining rules are sound.


### $Γ$ $⊧$ $φ$ implies Γ ⊦ $φ$ - Completeness

Whenever the assumptions in Γ semantically entail $φ$, they also prove it.

If something is true based on a set of assumptions, the rules in our proof system can prove it.

Natural deduction is sound and complete, so taking away any rule removes completeness
