# Hypothesis Testing The Mean Using The Normal Distribution

For normal values, we calculate the Z-score using standardisation, which is different for testing the normal mean:
$$ z_{\bar{y}}  = \frac{\bar{Y} - \mu_{guess}}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}} $$
**If the variance is unknown,** use the unbiased variance estimator: $$ \sigma^2= \frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{x=1}^i(y-\bar{y})^2  $$


**One-tailed tests for the p-value:**
The format we would need is: $$ p = \mathbb{P}(Z > -|z_{\bar{y}}|) $$
**Two-tailed tests for the p-value:**
The format we would need is: $$ p = 2\mathbb{P}(Z < -|z_{\bar{y}}|) $$
All ways of finding P values for each set of null and alternative hypotheses:
