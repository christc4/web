# [Functions](functions) as Special Relations

Any function $f: X \rightarrow Y$ is a special type of relation from $X$ to $Y$ that satisfies:

$$\forall x \in X.\ \exists y \in Y\ s.t.\ (x,y) \in f$$
This $y$ must be unique, and as a result:
$$((x, y) \in f)\ \land ((x, z) \in f) \implies y=z$$

The **graph** of $f$ emphasises that we are referring to $f$ as a relation.
