TARGET DECK

In the quick-find implementation of union-find, two elements `x` and `y` are connected, **if and only if** they have the same id.


ids are stored in an [Arrays|array](arrays|array).

`union(x, y)` - merges the equivalence class `x` belongs to (`id[x]`) with the equivalence class `y` belongs to (`id[y]`)
