Design Requirements detail how the system should be implemented.

They are also known as constraints.

There are three types:
	 - **Implementation Requirements** - Use of specific tools, languages, platforms
	 - **Interface Requirements** - Constraints imposed by existing systems (must work with other systems that already exist)
	 - **Legal Requirements** - Must work within the confines of the law

Considering a rocket system:
	- **Implementation Requirements:** Rocket code should be in Java
	- **Interface Requirements:** Rocket should be compatible with existing launching platforms
	- **Legal Requirements** - Rocket must not be louder than 120 dB
