TARGET DECK

Non-Functional Requirements detail how *well* the system performs its tasks.

There are three subtypes:
	 - How fast it does it (performance requirements)
	 - How easy the system is to use (usability requirements)
	 - How easy the system can evolve (maintainability/adaptability requirements)

For a rocket system:
	- **Performance Requirement:** Rocket should go to the moon and back in 72 hours
	- **Usability Requirement:** A commercial airline pilot should be able to use the rocket after a month of training
	- **Maintainability Requirement:** Must be able to use different types of fuel when available.
