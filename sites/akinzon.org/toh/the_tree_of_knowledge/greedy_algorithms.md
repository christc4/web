Greedy algorithms are a type of algorithm that makes **locally optimal** choices.

This means that even though there may be a better course of action based on looking at the problem as a whole (**globally optimal**), greedy algorithms make the best possible choice based on the limited information it has.

The hope for greedy algorithms is that in making locally optimal choices, the outcome will be a globally optimal solution.

When greedy algorithms work, they work well.
