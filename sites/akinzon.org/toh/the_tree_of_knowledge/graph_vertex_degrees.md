# Graph Vertex Degrees

Graph vertices also have what is known as a **degree** (remember [VVEEMAD](vveemad)?) 

Degrees have useful properties:
	- The sum of all degrees of all vertices is twice the number of edges: $\sum_{v \in V} deg(v) = 2|E|$  
	- For directed graphs, $\sum_{v \in V}indegree(v) = \sum_{v \in V}outdegree(v) = |E|$ (number of edges into all nodes = number of edges out of all nodes = number of edges.)
