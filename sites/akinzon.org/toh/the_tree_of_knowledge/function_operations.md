#### Function Composition
Functions can be **composed together** to create a function that is the same as performing the first function and then the next.

Example:
	$f: X→Y, g : Y→Z, f;g: X→Z$
	$(f ; g)(x) = g(f(x))$
	(^Left function first, then right)
	$g ∘ f$ (Right function first, then left)
(Is associative)
(Not commutative, f;g **≠** g:f)

#### Inverse Functions
If a function $f: X→Y$ has an inverse, it means that its inverse, $f^-1$ maps Y to X.

For inverse functions:
	$f^-1(f(x))=x (f ; f^-1 = id_X)$
	$f(f^-1(y))=y (f^-1 ; f = id_Y)$
	
Inverse functions can be used to prove the [Functions (Advanced)|bijectivity](functions_(advanced)|bijectivity) of a function.
