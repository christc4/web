# Finding out if a Functional Dependency Holds for a Schema

The problem of finding out if a functional dependency holds for all [Relation Schemas|schema](relation_schemas|schema) is a hard one, since at first glance we would have to prove that it holds for all instances of a schema.

With only one instance, we can only find out which FDs do **not** hold for a schema, not which FDs do hold.

This is because while we may have failed to prove that it does not hold on one instance, it does not mean that it will fail to hold for another instance.
