Considering a set of intervals in the form $(s, e)$ where $s$ and $e$ are the start and end times respectively.

We want to choose as many **non-overlapping** intervals as possible.

The way this is done is by checking all possible ways in which intervals can be chosen (shortest interval first, smallest start time first, smallest number of overlaps) and seeing which one would actually form a **correct** solution for this problem.
