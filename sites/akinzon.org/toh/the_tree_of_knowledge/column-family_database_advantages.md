TARGET DECK

Column-family databases are very flexible, allowing for dynamic addition and creation of columns. This allows for a quicker response to changes in data requirements.

Column-family databases lend themselves well to scaling horizontally since they can easily distribute the workload amongst nodes. They do this through partitioning.

Column-family databases allow for each row to have its own set of columns and for columns to have their own data type. Since rows only have as many columns as they need, data can be stored very efficiently.

Column-family databases can be queried efficiently using their own querying languages which query based on column values.
