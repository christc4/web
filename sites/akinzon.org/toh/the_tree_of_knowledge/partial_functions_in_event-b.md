Partial Functions are the most general type of function in Event-B, where each element in the domain can have at most one element that it maps to.

partial functions take this form:

$$ f \in X \nrightarrow Y$$
(but the slanted line should be vertical!!!)

If $x$ maps to some $y$, then it cannot map to a $y' \ne y$ .
