TARGET DECK

Imagine that you wanted to create a bunch of related [classes](classes), each with different features.

The class hierarchy would be huge! And to top it all off, these classes are as simple as they can get, so the [Bridge Design Pattern](bridge_design_pattern) doesn't apply here.

The Decorator Design Pattern solves this problem of adding many features to [objects](objects) without having to create new classes for each combination of features by placing objects in special wrapper objects that have each feature.

That way, you can mix and match!
