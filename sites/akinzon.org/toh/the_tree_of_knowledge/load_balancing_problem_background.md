The problem is as follows:

We are given $n$ tasks with processing times $t_1,t_2,...,t_n$

The goal is to distribute the $n$ tasks across $m$ machines as evenly as possible.

The **load** of a machine is the sum of the processing times of each task it has been allocated.

The value to be optimised is the **makespan**, which is the maximum load out of all machines.

If we denote the load any machine $M$ from $M_0$ to $M_m$ as being $L(M_i)$, then the formal definition for the makespan would be:
$$ max_{1 \le i \le m}\ L(M_i) $$
