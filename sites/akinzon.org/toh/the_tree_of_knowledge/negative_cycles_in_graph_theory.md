If a bunch of edges' weights can be summed together forever **but it goes to negative infinity**, they form a negative cycle.

This is a cycle that contains an edge with a  [Negative Weights in Graph Theory|negative weight](negative_weights_in_graph_theory|negative_weight) or multiple negative weights where the sum of the absolute value of the negative weights is greater than the sum of the positive weights.
