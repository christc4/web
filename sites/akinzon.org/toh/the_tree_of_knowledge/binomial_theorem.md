To find the coefficient of $x^py^q$, find the $k\ (1 ≤ k ≤ n, k ∈ N)$ that gives $x^py^q$. And if $k$ doesn't exist, then $x^py^q$ isn't in the expansion.

> [!TIP]- Prove that the coefficient of $x^3y^3$ in $(x^2 + y^2)^3$ is 0 
> Let $c = [x^3y^3](x^2 + y^2)^3$
> $cx^3y^3 = \binom{3}{k}(x^2)^k(y^2)^{3-k}\ = \ \binom{3}{k}x^{2k}y^{6-2k}$
> Comparing indices, there must be a $k$ such that $3 = 2k$ AND $3-k = 6-2k$
> There is no such solution, and therefore $x^3y^3$ does not exist in $(x^2 + y^2)^3$ and c is 0.
