TARGET DECK

**Find Your Level:** With insertion sorts, you start at the 2nd item in the array (The first item is a sorted sublist of size 1), work your way to the end, and keep checking for if the element you're on is less than any item before it, and look for the best position to *insert* it in the array.

This position may be at the end of the array (it's larger than all the elements in front of it), somewhere in the middle if $x \le y \le z$ holds for a value $y$ and two elements of the sublist $x$ and $z$, or at the very front, if it is smaller than all the other elements.
