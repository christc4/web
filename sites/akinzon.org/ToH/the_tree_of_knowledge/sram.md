Static RAM stores bits as on/off gates, using 4-6 [transistors](transistors)

Since it uses transistors, no charge leaks, so no refreshing needed. Hooray!!!

However, it's not all sunshine and rainbows. Its construction is more complex and its MUCH (100x) more expensive per bit.

It's faster though (0.5 - 10 ns)

It's mainly used for [Cache](cache) and embedded RAM
