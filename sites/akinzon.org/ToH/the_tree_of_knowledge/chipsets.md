#### What The Heck Are They??

Chipsets link all a computer's components.

Old PC architecture used a chipset to join the main buses

^ AS YOU CAN SEE, there are two bridges (north and south) connected to different devices. North handled the faster devices ([RAM](ram), [THe Processor|CPU](the_processor|cpu), [The GPU|GPU](the_gpu|gpu)) while South handled the slower devices ([Hard Disk Drives|disks](hard_disk_drives|disks) and peripherals)

As chipsets evolved, the use of PCI fell out of favour, in favour of [PCIe](pcie).

In some cases, some motherboards have switches to select between which devices talk to the chipset

SoC ([System on a Chip](system_on_a_chip)) - fitting an entire computer on a chip
#### Some Examples...

What are chipsets, and how do they work? (historically and currently) #flashcard 
[Chipsets](chipsets) connect all the devices on a computer.
Old ones had a North and South bridge, the North bridge controlled faster devices while the South bridge controlled the slower devices.
Current chipsets only use one chip, connecting to everything using [PCIe](pcie).

See [UEFI](uefi), [BIOS](bios)

What are BIOS and UEFI #flashcard 
[BIOS](bios) helps with booting up [the operating system](the_operating_system), and [UEFI](uefi) is its CPU-independent upgrade.
