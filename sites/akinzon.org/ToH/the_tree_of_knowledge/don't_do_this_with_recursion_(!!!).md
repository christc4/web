**DON'T** make a recursive method that is equivalent to `while (true)`.

â€¦*just don't.*

WHAT SHOULDN'T YOU DO IN JAVA WITH RECURSION!!! (And why?) #flashcard 
DO NOT MAKE A RECURSIVE METHOD THAT IS THE SAME AS `while(true)` OR ELSE I WILL EAT YOU!!!
Because every time the method calls itself, a new [The Java Stack Frame|stack frame](the_java_stack_frame|stack_frame) is created, and if this looks like it will go on forever, this will lead to a stack overflow (KABOOM)
