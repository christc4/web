TARGET DECK

White-box testing is a form of software testing where the tester has access to the source code and underlying structure of the system.

Since the tester has access to the code, their testing emphasis is on if the [data structures](data_structures) and [methods](methods) work as planned.

Since they'll mainly be testing methods and data structures, the tester must have some programming and implementation-specific knowledge!

As a result, it will typically be done by developers and testers only.

Since code-access is requires, this *does* open up the risk of the code being stolen by a third-party tester.
