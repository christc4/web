These rules aim to assert that no path from the root to a leaf, or to a node with one child is twice as long as any other path.

**Red Rule:** The children of a red node must be black

**Black Rule:** The number of black nodes must be equal in all paths from the root to nodes with no children or nodes with one child.

The children of all red nodes in the tree are black, and in each path to nodes with no children or one child, there are 2 black nodes for all such paths.
