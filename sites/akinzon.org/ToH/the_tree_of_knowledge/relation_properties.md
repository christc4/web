For a relation $R$ on a set $X$ it can have the following properties:

**Reflexivity** - all values are related to themselves -  $xRx$ 
(think of equality as a relation, 5 = 5)
in other words, $(x,x) \in R$.

**Symmetry** - if $xRy$, then $yRx$
(think of inequality, 4 $\neq$ 5 and so 5 $\neq$ 4)

**Transitivity** - if $xRy$ and $yRz$, then $xRz$ 
(think of $\lt$, if 1 $\lt$ 2 and 2 $\lt$ 3, then 1 $\lt$ 3 )

Relations need not have any of these properties, they only help to describe a relation. However, if a relation has all three properties, it is an [Equivalence Relations|equivalence relation.](equivalence_relations|equivalence_relation.)
