Recalling that for sets $X$ and $Y$, their [Set Operations|Cartesian Product](set_operations|cartesian_product) is the [Sets|set](sets|set) of all [ordered pairs](ordered_pairs) $(x,y)$ where $x \in X$ and $y \in Y$, **Binary relations** are some set $(x,y)$ where $x \in X$ and $y \in Y$

Therefore, such a relation $R \subseteq X \times Y$ 

**Relations on X** - Also known as Relations from X to X

**Other Relation examples**
	The full relation: $X \times Y$ 
	The empty relation: $\emptyset \subseteq X \times Y$
	The identity relation: $I_X = \{ (x, x) | x âˆˆ X \}$

**Did you know??** Directed [Intro to Graph Theory|graphs](intro_to_graph_theory|graphs) (digraphs) with a maximum of one edge from one node to another can be formalised as a binary relation on the [VVEEMAD|set of vertices](vveemad|set_of_vertices).

We can write a relation between $x$ and $y$ as $xRy$.
