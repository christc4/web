TARGET DECK

For some [Relation Schemas|relation schema](relation_schemas|relation_schema) $X$ and a set of attributes $R$:
	$X$ is a **superkey** of $R$ if $X \rightarrow A_i,\ \forall A_i \in R$
	$X$ is a **key** or **candidate key** of $R$ if it is a minimal superkey of $R$. (superkey with the fewest number of attributes)

It is called the superkey because its set of attributes is a [sets|superset](sets|superset) of the candidate key.

The set of all attributes is a superkey for each relation.
