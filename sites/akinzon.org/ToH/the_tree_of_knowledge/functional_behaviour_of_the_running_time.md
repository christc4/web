For an algorithm with a [Running Time of an Algorithm|running time](running_time_of_an_algorithm|running_time) $4n^2 + 12n + 199$, as $n$ becomes very large, its value is mainly influenced by the $4n^2$ term, and so this is what is only focused on when considering its [Asymptotic Behaviour of the Running Time|asymptotic behaviour](asymptotic_behaviour_of_the_running_time|asymptotic_behaviour). 

Furthermore, we can even ignore the 4, and focus solely on $n^2$. This  most influential power of k in a running time is its **functional behaviour.**

Algorithms with the same functional behaviour grow at the same rate!\
