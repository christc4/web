Bipartite Graphs are graphs such that it can be split up into two sets $V_1$ and $V_2$ such that:

$(u,v) \in E \implies (u \in V_1\ \land v \in V_2)\ \lor (u \in V_2\ \land v \ in V_1)$

An informal way of putting this is that if some nodes were the colour green, all their neighbours would be of another colour. **No green node can have a green neighbour,** and the same for the other colour.
