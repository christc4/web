TARGET DECK

[Merge sort](merge_sort) is **asymptotically optimal** due to it being $\Theta(n log (n)$ even in the worst case.

[Quicksort](quicksort) is suboptimal in this regard due to it being $\Theta(n^2)$ in the worst case (WHAT)

Quick sort is in-place tho unlike merge sort

Merge sort is stable tho, unlike quicksort
