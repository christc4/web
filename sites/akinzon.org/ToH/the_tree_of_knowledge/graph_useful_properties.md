The sum of all adjacencies in a directed graph = the number of edges:
$$ \sum_{\forall v \in V} |adj[v]| = |E| $$

For an undirected graph, each adjacency has a *clone*, more formally:
$$ \forall (u,v) \in E \cdot \exists\  e \in E : e = (v, u) $$
Therefore, the above summation is doubled for an undirected graph:
$$ \sum_{\forall v \in V} |adj[v]| = 2|E| $$
