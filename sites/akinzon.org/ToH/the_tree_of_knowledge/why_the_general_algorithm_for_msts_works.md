The reason why [Prim's Algorithm for Minimum Spanning Trees|Prim's Algorithm](prim's_algorithm_for_minimum_spanning_trees|prim's_algorithm) and [Kruskal's Algorithm for Minimum Spanning Trees|Kruskal's Algorithm](kruskal's_algorithm_for_minimum_spanning_trees|kruskal's_algorithm) works is because of this theorem:

> [!tip] Let $A$ be a [Sets|set](sets|set) of edges included in some minimum spanning tree, let $(S, V - S)$ a [Cuts in Graph Theory|cut](cuts_in_graph_theory|cut) that respects $A$, and $(u, v)$ a [Light Edges in Graph Theory|light edge](light_edges_in_graph_theory|light_edge) that crosses $(S, V - S)$. Then, $(u, v)$ is safe for $A$.
