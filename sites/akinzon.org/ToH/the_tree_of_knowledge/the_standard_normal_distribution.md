The standard normal distribution is when $\mu = 0$ and $\sigma =  1$.

All normal distribution curves are translated and scaled version of the Standard Normal.

If $$ Z \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 1) $$
Then $$ X = \sigma Z+ \mu \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2) $$

If $$  X \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2)  $$
Then $$ Z = \frac{X-\mu}{\sigma} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 1) $$
The process $\frac{X-\mu}{\sigma}$ is known as standardisation.

The random variable for a standard normal distribution is called the standard $z$-score.

The standard normal can be computed using the [Error Function](error_function)
