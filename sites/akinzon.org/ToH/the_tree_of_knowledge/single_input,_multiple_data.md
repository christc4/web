TARGET DECK

**Single input, Multiple Data** is a computer architecture that performs the same instruction on multiple pieces of data where possible.

For it to work, it must both be supported in hardware  through the use of large [Registers|registers](registers|registers) (64/128/256-bit), and in the software (there must be values that can be used in a SIMD fashion, otherwise there won't be much benefit from SIMD.)

**Uses:** [SSE and AVX](sse_and_avx)
