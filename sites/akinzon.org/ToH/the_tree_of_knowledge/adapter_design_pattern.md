The Adapter design pattern solves the problem of using an incompatible 3rd party library with your own code.

Adapters convert the interface of one [Objects|object](objects|object) so that the other object can understand it.

The adapter has an interface that object 1 can call, and converts these calls into a format that object 2 can understand.

Adapters can even be two-way!
