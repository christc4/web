Tableaus are degenerate if one of the $b$'s is zero

A **pivot** is degenerate if the leaving variable has a [Choosing the Leaving Variable|zero ratio](choosing_the_leaving_variable|zero_ratio).

Sometimes, degenerate pivots lead to a simplex cycle.

A simplex cycle is when a tableau at a given time $T_i = T_j$ when $j \lt i$.

If this is ever the case, the simplex will not terminate.
