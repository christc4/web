### The Hub (SHUUUSH)

Hubs are multi-port repeaters that send packets to all computers

This is bad as it can result in a collision if two devices try to transmit at the same time

### Switch it up

Switches connect multiple devices too but packets are only send to the specified ports

These operate on the [TCP IP model|Network Access Layer](tcp_ip_model|network_access_layer)

Why are switches better than hubs? What is a specific problem with the way hubs work? #flashcard 
Switches are better than hubs because they only send packets to the specified device while hubs send it to all computers.
Hubs send packets to all computers which can result in more collisions if two devices try to transmit at the same time.
