Brother: [Data dependencies (and branch issues) that can prevent the parallelisation of instructions and pipelines](data_dependencies_(and_branch_issues)_that_can_prevent_the_parallelisation_of_instructions_and_pipelines)

When two instructions want to write to the same [Registers|register](registers|register) and so cannot be parallelised  
because both write operations (to the same register) cannot happen at the same time.
