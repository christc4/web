TARGET DECK

In a **Model**, there is a set A:
	For each constant symbol a, a ∈ A
	For each n-ary function symbol f, f : A^n → A
	For each n-ary relation symbol R, R ⊆ A^n

With a function σ that maps from variables to elements of A, any term now has a corresponding element of A.

	^ Variables map to some term in A

**Logical Equivalence** - Two formulas are logically equivalent if a particular model is a model for both.

**Semantic entailment** - Any model A for all formulae in Γ is also a model for $φ$
