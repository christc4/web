### Associative Mapping

Blocks of memory can be loaded into either any line of cache or into a set of lines (set-associative mapping)

The memory address is interpreted as a tag and a word

Every tag must be checked, since the tag uniquely identifies a cache line (Not good oh, but it works, I guess.)

^AS YOU CAN SEE, all tags are compared to the memory address's tag. This means that the comparator will need to be able to take all those inputs.
