All algorithms of note need to be (in decreasing order of importance):
	**Correct:** Produces the right output for any input
	**Efficient:** Aiming for less than polynomial [Time Complexity of an Algorithm|time complexity](time_complexity_of_an_algorithm|time_complexity).
	**Easy to implement:** This is more of a human requirement but it should be easy for humans to understand and code.
