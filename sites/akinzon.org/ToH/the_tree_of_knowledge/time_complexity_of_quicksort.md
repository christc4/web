# Time Complexity of Quicksort

Up: [Quicksort](quicksort)

TARGET DECK

Partitioning is $\Theta(n)$.

Worst case: $O(n^2)$ **DAMN** (This is *super* rare, and only happens when the [The Importance of Choosing A Good Pivot|pivot](the_importance_of_choosing_a_good_pivot|pivot) chosen is in ascending or descending order, at which point the algorithm becomes akin to a [selection sort](selection_sort).)

Average case: $O(nlog_2(n))$ 

Quick sort is generally **very fast**, being close to $O(n)$.

It may have 39% more comparisons than merge sort, but due to much less data movement, it makes up for that.
