The Determinant **determines** if a matrix has an inverse, if the determinant is not 0, it has an inverse.

Denoted by: $$ detA, |A| $$

#### Minors and Cofactors

The **Minor**, $M_{i,j}$ of a matrix is the determinant of a matrix obtained by deleting the $i^{th}$ row and the $j^{th}$ column.

The $(i, j)$ **Cofactor** of a matrix is obtained by multiplying the determinant of the minor by $(-1)^{i+j}$.

The determinant of an upper-triangular matrix (think [Gaussian Elimination|row echelon form](gaussian_elimination|row_echelon_form)) is the product of the values on the diagonal.


#### Determinant calculation tips and tricks:
Use the row with the most 1's or 0's for your minors since the $minor \cdot cofactor$ where the minor is 0 = 0.
