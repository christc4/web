$R \in S \leftrightarrow T$ and $A \subseteq S$

Restricting a domain $R$ by $A$ is written as $A \triangleleft R$.

This means that $A \triangleleft R$ only contains [ordered pairs](ordered_pairs) whose first part is in $A$.

This can also be used on the range, and is written as $R \triangleright B$, where $R \triangleright B$ only contains ordered pairs whose second part is in $B$.

There is also subtraction for the domain and range, denoted by $A \ntriangleleft R$ (but the line is horizontal!!!) and $R \ntriangleright B$ respectively, where those subtractions contain ordered pairs whose first and second parts are **NOT** in $A$ and $B$ respectively.
