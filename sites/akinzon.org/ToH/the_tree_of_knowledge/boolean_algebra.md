With Boolean algebra, there is a 1:1 correspondence between gates and operations
#### AND gate $$ X \cdot Y $$ 
Only yields 1 when $X$ AND $Y$ are both 1 - bijective with conjunctions from [Logic](logic) and [Set Operations|intersections](set_operations|intersections) from [Sets](sets)

#### OR gate $$X + Y $$
Only needs either $X$ OR $Y$ to be 1 to yield 1 - bijective with disjunctions from [Logic](logic) and [Set Operations|unions](set_operations|unions) from [Sets](sets)

#### NOT gate $$ \bar X $$
Inverts the value of $X$.

#### XOR gate $$ X \oplus Y $$
Yields 1 when $X$ or $Y$ is 1, but not both. Bijective with [Inclusion-Exclusion Principle](inclusion-exclusion_principle) since the intersection is cut out.

It may be useful to know that:
$$ \bar X \cdot Y + X \cdot \bar Y = X \oplus Y $$

There are also **NAND** and **NOR** gates, which invert the output of AND and OR gates respectively.

There is a **XAND** gate, **XNAND** gate, **XNOR** gate, and so on.
