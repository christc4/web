TARGET DECK

People who follow [The Object-Oriented Paradigm](the_object-oriented_paradigm) claim that [Stair-like Sequence Diagrams|stair diagrams](stair-like_sequence_diagrams|stair_diagrams) are better.


| [Forked Sequence Diagrams](forked_sequence_diagrams) | [Stair-like Sequence Diagrams](stair-like_sequence_diagrams) |
