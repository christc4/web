# Structure of Recursion

Recursive functions are defined like this:
	- The Base Case: This is the part where solving the problem is easy
	- The Recursive Step: This is the self-referring part that **must** reach the base case

It is often helpful to start with the base case.

This structure is rather similar to [Proof by Induction](proof_by_induction).
