Given an algorithm with a running time $4n^2 + 12n + 199$, the **asymptotic behaviour** would be the behaviour of the algorithm as $n$ becomes very large, and tends to infinity.

This is similar to the idea of asymptotes in geometry, where a curve can get very close to an asymptote but never truly reach it, and is only said to do so as it tends to infinity.

Related to this is the [Functional Behaviour of the Running Time](functional_behaviour_of_the_running_time).
