If ~ is an equivalence relation on the [Sets|set](sets|set) $X$ and $a \in X$ then
the equivalence class of $a$ is the set $$[a] = \{x\ |\ x\ \in X\ and\ x \sim a \}$$ 
	$a \in [a]$ due to [Relation Properties|reflexivity](relation_properties|reflexivity)
	$X/\sim\ = \{ [x]\ |\ x âˆˆ X \}$ (The quotient of $X,\ w.r.t. \sim$)

These have a nice application in [Equivalence Classes (Programming)|programming](equivalence_classes_(programming)|programming).
