TARGET DECK

Typically in software development, defects and inconsistencies that could cause the system to fail are discovered too late, after most of production has taken place.

Wouldn't it be nice to find these inconsistencies early on?

Finding these errors normally is hard, due to the imprecision of natural language, as opposed to for formal language.

Furthermore, wouldn't we want to be able to prove our system works as expected, as well as test?
