The clock is the grand maestro of the CPU - By continuously emitting a pulse that oscillates between 0 (low) and 1 (high), this pulse is used to synchronise system operations as they can be timed to happen on the clock rising edge (going from low to high state)

Clocks have a frequency, measured in Hz (but since they're so fast, GHz) which measures how many clock cycles (time between two sequential rising edges) they can complete in a second. For example, a 1 GHz clock speed means 1,000,000,000 clock cycles (of 1 nanosecond each) can be completed in a second.
