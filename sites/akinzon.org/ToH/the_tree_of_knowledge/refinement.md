Refinement is how a model is modified by **adding** more detail to it.

Refinements are done by:
	- Increasing the functionality being modelled
	- Explaining (adding detail) on how the system's purpose is achieved.

Refinement is the opposite of [Abstraction](abstraction).

[Refinement and Abstraction - Yin and Yang](refinement_and_abstraction_-_yin_and_yang)

Properties in a model are preserved during refinement, since we aren't removing detail but adding it.
