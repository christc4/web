What does it mean for $f(n) = \Theta(g(n))$ (normal and mathematical definition) #flashcard 
It means $g(n)$ is an asymptotically tight bound for $f(n)$, that $f(n)$ can run no lower than $c \cdot g(n)$ and no higher than $d \cdot g(n)$ for some constants $c$ and $d$ .   
It means that we can find two constants $c$ and $d$ and an $n_0$ 
such that $0 \leq cg(n) \le f(n) \le dg(n)$ for all $n \ge n_0$.
