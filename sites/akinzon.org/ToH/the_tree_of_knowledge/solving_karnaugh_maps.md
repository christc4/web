### Given this example ![Pasted image 20240109174514.png](pasted_image_20240109174514.png)

Simplify it down.

> [!TIP]- Answer:
> Form the largest multiples-of-2 implicant groups 
> We are allowed to wrap-around, so the two middle pairs of 1's on the outer columns form one big group
> For this group, B' and D do not change, so it is B'D
> We have another group of 4 1's down the last column, the only thing that does not change is A and B' so we have AB' for that group
> For the final little group in the last two cells, C, D' and A do not change so we have ACD'
> The final answer is B'D + AB' + ACD'.
