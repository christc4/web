In programming, we sometimes call a neat and elegant way of solving a problem a **design pattern.**

Design patterns are:
	- A reusable template for solving recurring problems
	- Design knowledge, better than [1201 Algorithmics|algorithms](1201_algorithmics|algorithms) or [data structures](data_structures)
	- Modifiable designs, adaptable to many situations.
