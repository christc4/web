Let $z_r^*$ be the optimal value of the [linear programming](linear_programming) relaxation, and let $z^*$ be the optimal value of the original problem.

For the relaxation we made some of the constraints less strict, which essentially allows for values into [the feasible region](the_feasible_region).

Therefore, the feasible region for the LP relaxation is a [Set Rules and Syntax|superset](set_rules_and_syntax|superset) of the feasible region for the original problem.

Therefore, $z_r^* \le z^*$ and the LP relaxation's solution is a lower bound on the original problem.
