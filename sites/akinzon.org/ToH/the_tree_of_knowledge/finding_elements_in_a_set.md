# Finding Elements in a Set

TARGET DECK

In similar spirit to [Searching Binary Search Trees](searching_binary_search_trees), we only need to navigate down the tree until we find the node or reach the end, which is where comparing nodes using our [Implementing the Comparable Interface|compareTo()](implementing_the_comparable_interface|compareto()) [methods|method](methods|method) is useful.

This in turn helps us with [Checking if a Node Exists in the Set|checking if a node exists](checking_if_a_node_exists_in_the_set|checking_if_a_node_exists).
