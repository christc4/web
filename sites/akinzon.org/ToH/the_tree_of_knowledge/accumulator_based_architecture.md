In this architecture, a variable A is loaded into the [The Accumulator|accumulator](the_accumulator|accumulator), and the value B is ADDed directly to it, getting the value straight from [RAM|memory](ram|memory). The result X is stored in the accumulator, and can then be stored in memory.

Benefit - short instructions

Disadvantages - Only one storage location, and its *temporary* 
 - This results in a lot of data transfer.

How does accumulator based architecture work, give an advantage and disadvantage #flashcard 
In [Accumulator based architecture](accumulator_based_architecture), a value is loaded into the accumulator with the 2nd value being added directly to it straight from [RAM|memory](ram|memory). 
It has short instructions but only one storage location.
