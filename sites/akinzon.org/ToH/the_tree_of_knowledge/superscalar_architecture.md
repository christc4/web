# Superscalar architecture

Up: [Pipelining, Parallelisation and superscalar architecture](pipelining,_parallelisation_and_superscalar_architecture)
Brother: [The Pipeline](the_pipeline)

Taking scalar instructions that do not rely on each other and parallelising them  
  
For example, Floating Point Units and integer ALUs are kept separate from each other and so their respective  
computations can be run in parallel
