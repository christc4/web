The leaving variable is chosen by dividing $b_i$ by the value in the corresponding entering variable column.

The lowest **positive** quotient for each current basic variable is the one getting kicked out hahaha

This is known as the **minimum ratio test**, and can be more formally defined as such:

to find leaving variable $x_r$, given entering variable $x_s$:

$$ min_{i=1}^{m} \frac{b_i}{a_{is}} $$
