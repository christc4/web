# [Primitives](primitives) and [ArrayLists](arraylists)

As you may know, ArrayLists can only contain [objects](objects), and so we can't use them to store primitives.

But we can get around that [Limitations of ArrayLists|limitation](limitations_of_arraylists|limitation).

We can use a **wrapper object**, to turn the primitive into an object so that they can be stored in ArrayLists.

we may not be able to store `int` (primitive) in an `ArrayList`, but we can store an `Integer` (object).

You do have to turn it back into an `int` using `getIntValue()` where necessary, however.

But [Autoboxing and Unboxing](autoboxing_and_unboxing) exist.
