TARGET DECK

If we had a [Graphs|graph](graphs|graph) $G = (V, E)$, an independent set is a [Sets|subset](sets|subset) of the vertices $S \subseteq V$ such that no two edges $x$ and $y$ share an edge: $(x, y) \notin E$

The problem is that we want to have the maximal cardinality of $S$.

Furthermore, we also want to have the maximum possible weighting, given that each node has an associated weight $w_i$.
