# Defining the Scope

Up: [System Scope](system_scope)

TARGET DECK

When defining the scope, we need to consider/outline:
1) **Need:** What problem is solved? What needs are satisfied? Why does the company want this? (project-based need)
2) **Goals:** What is the intended purpose? What functionality is provided?
3) **Business Case:** How efficient is the proposed system, or how can we make *dinheiro?*
4) **Stakeholders:** Who will be affected by the system, whether directly or indirectly?
5) **High-level operational concepts:** How the system will be used, without getting into implementation specifics (see [Noun - Verb Method](noun_-_verb_method))
6) **Success criteria:** Measurable goals (SMART objectives) to gauge success
