TARGET DECK

**Encapsulation** is wrapping all relevant attributes and [methods](methods) into a single object, with direct access to such data being being prevented.

It is the idea that **a class should be responsible for managing itself.**

Classes should instead present **[Interfaces|interfaces](interfaces|interfaces)** to the rest of the program.

to encapsulate a [Variables|variable](variables|variable), you put either `private` or `protected` behind it in its declaration, *like so*:
```java
public class Person {
	private age = 10; // age is now private, and cannot be accessed directly
}
```
