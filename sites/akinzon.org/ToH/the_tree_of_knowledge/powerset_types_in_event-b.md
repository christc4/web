[Sets](sets) themselves can have types!

If elements of a set $S$  are of the type $S$, then since all sets (and their subsets) are members of the **[Set Operations|powerset](set_operations|powerset)** of $S$, wouldn't it suffice to say that such sets are of the type $\mathbb{P}(S)$?

Exactly!

Such types are known as being **constructed**, since they were essentially created from the set they are a powerset of.
