TARGET DECK

ACID is an acronym for 4 guiding principles for relational databases.

**Atomicity:** Transactions should be atomic - either they happen or they don't, nothing in between.

**Consistency preservation:** Transactions should preserve consistency, meaning that if a transaction occurs, it should take the database from one consistent state to another.

**Isolation:** Transactions must not be interfered with by any other transaction, even if they are running concurrently.

**Durability/Permanency:** Changes made to data in a database must *persist,* meaning that they should remain in the database even if a failure occurs.
