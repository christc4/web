Relations can be **composed,** combining two relations as you would with [Function Operations|functions](function_operations|functions) to create new ones!

Given a relation $R$ from $X$ to $Y$ and a relation $S$ from $Y$ to $Z$, $R ; S$ is a relation from $X$ to $Z$ where: 
$$ (x, z) \in R\ \ if\  \exists y \in Y\ s.t.\ (such\ that)\ (x, y) \in R\ and\ (y, z) \in S$$
The pair $(x, z)$ only exists in the relation $R;S$ if there is a **linking value**, namely a $y \in Y$ where $\exists (x, y) \in R$ and for that same y, $\exists (y, z) \in S$. 

Relation composition is associative.
