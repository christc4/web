Solving a problem recursively is when that problem is reduced to subproblems that are easier to solve.

This is repeated until we reach a trivial case of the problem that can be solved some other way.

Recursion also defines self-referential functions such as the definition of the **factorial:**

$$ n! = \begin{cases} 
n \times (n-1)!\ for\ n>0 \\
1\ for \ n = 0
\end{cases} $$
