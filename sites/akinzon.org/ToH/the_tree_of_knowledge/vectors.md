**Vectors**, are simply elements of a vector space. Instead of opting for a fancy definition of vectors, it is better to define it by the operations that can be done on a vector and the properties of those operations.

#### Representing Vectors
Vectors can be represented as:
	**Row vectors:** - (1, 2)
	**Column vectors**: $\begin{bmatrix} 4 \cr 4 \end{bmatrix}$
	You can switch between row and column vectors through **transposition** (swapping rows and columns)


#### Basis Vectors
Vectors in an n-dimensional plane can be represented as the linear combination of n basis vectors.
