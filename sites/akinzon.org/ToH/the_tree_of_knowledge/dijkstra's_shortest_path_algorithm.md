### THE GOAT. Greedy.

This algorithm works its way through a [Priority Queues|min priority](priority_queues|min_priority) queue of unvisited nodes, adding each visited node to a set of visited nodes.
We attempt to [Edge Relaxation|relax()](edge_relaxation|relax()) each node we come across until we have visited all nodes.
