If $X$ and $Y$ are two random variables, then:
$$ {\mathbb{V}[aX + bY+ c]} = a^2\mathbb{V}[X] + 2abcov(X,Y) + b^2\mathbb{V}[Y] $$
And if $X$ and $Y$ are independent, their covariance is 0 (since they don't affect each other), and so in this special case:
$$  {\mathbb{V}[aX + bY+ c]} = a^2\mathbb{V}[X]  + b^2\mathbb{V}[Y]  $$
