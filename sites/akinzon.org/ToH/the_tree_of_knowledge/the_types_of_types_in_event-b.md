Some types are **predefined,** such as integers ($\mathbb{Z}$) and booleans ($\mathbb{B}$). 

Types can also be **user-defined**, by defining a [Carrier Sets|carrier set](carrier_sets|carrier_set) within a [Event-B Context|context](event-b_context|context).

[Powerset Types in Event-B](powerset_types_in_event-b)

[Ordered Pair Types in Event-B](ordered_pair_types_in_event-b)
