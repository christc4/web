**Linear maps** map from one vector space to another, consider a [Functions|function](functions|function) $$ T: V → W $$

These maps are called linear since $$ T(ax+by)=aT(x)+bT(y) ∀x∀y, ∈ V , a,b ∈ R $$

There is a 1:1 correspondence between Linear maps and [Matrices](matrices), matrices are the co-ordinate representations of linear maps.
