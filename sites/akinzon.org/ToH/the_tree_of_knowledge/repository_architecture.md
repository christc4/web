In this style, independent components/clients all read from/write to a central **repository** where everything is stores.

The repository is passive because it does no processing of its own, data is just stored/accessed in it.

Clients are passive because they do all the processing.

**Intuition:** Think of a bunch of students using a single whiteboard to write all their work on. They can look at other's work because it's all on the same whiteboard.
