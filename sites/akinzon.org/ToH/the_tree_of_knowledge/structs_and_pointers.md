Yep, pointers can be used to point to structures!

This is how:

```C
struct structName *pointerName;
```

or using [typedef](typedef):

```C
newStructName *pointerName;
```


And then it is initialised as normal.

You can [Memory Allocation in C|malloc](memory_allocation_in_c|malloc), [Memory Allocation + Initialisation in C|calloc](memory_allocation_+_initialisation_in_c|calloc) and [Memory Reallocation in C|realloc](memory_reallocation_in_c|realloc) with structures just like with any other variable as well.

Structures can also have pointers as member variables.
