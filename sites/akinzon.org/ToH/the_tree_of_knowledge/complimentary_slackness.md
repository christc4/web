take $x_1y_4$ as an example: 

$x_1$ is a variable for the primal, and $y_4$ a **slack variable** for the dual.

We start off not knowing the values for **any** of $\{x_1,...,x_5\}$ and $\{y_1,...,y_5\}$.
But we actually know the values for $y_3$ and $y_5$ since we worked them out in an earlier question.

The reason why we know that $x_2$ and $x_5$ is 0 is because since we know what $y_3$ and $y_5$ are, with $x_2y_5$ and $x_5y_3$ both $=0$, it **has** to be the case for $x_2$ and $x_5$ to be 0 to satisfy those equations.

Now that we know the values for $x_2$ and $x_5$, we can work out the values for the rest of $\{x_1,...,x_5\}$ by plugging in $x_2$ and $x_5$ into the primal's constraints.
