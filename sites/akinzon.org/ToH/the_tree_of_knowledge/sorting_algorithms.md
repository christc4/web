With sorting algorithms, we care about [Stability of an Algorithm|stability](stability_of_an_algorithm|stability) and how [When an Algorithm is In-place|in-place](when_an_algorithm_is_in-place|in-place) it is.

We are also concerned with all cases for the time complexity, if an algorithm performs well even in its worst case, it is a really good algorithm.
