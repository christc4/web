# The bus

Up: [Digital Logic](digital_logic)

A bus is a communication pathway (although typically consist of multiple pathways), connecting multiple devices  
  
Buses are a shared [Data Transmission|transmission](data_transmission|transmission) medium, and so only one device can transmit at a time,  
otherwise the simultaneous transmissions will interfere with each other.
