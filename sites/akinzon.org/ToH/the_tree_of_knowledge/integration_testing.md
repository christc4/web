Integration testing done by continuously testing connected parts of the system, in increasing order of size.

Integration testing is done after [Unit Testing](unit_testing), and before [System Testing](system_testing).

Integration Testing involves both [White-Box Testing](white-box_testing) and [Black-Box Testing](black-box_testing).

[JUnit](junit) + [EasyMock](easymock) is a good combo for integration tests.
