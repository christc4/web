Vectors are linearly independent if none of the vectors can be represented as a linear combination of the others.
$$ v_1 =∑_{i≠1} α_i v_i ,α_i≠0,i>1 $$

Equations in the form:
$$ A  x=0 $$
Are called homogenous equations, these are when a vector x is sent to the origin by a [Matrices|matrix](matrices|matrix) transformation.

The zero vector is always a solution, and so it is trivial (we don't care about it usually). As a result, the [Nullspace of a Matrix|nullspace](nullspace_of_a_matrix|nullspace) is never empty.

Solutions of $$ Ax = 0 $$
Determine if the columns of the matrix A are linearly independent.


The **span** of a set of vectors V is the set of all linear combinations that can be formed from V. 

The **dimension** of a vector space V is the number of basis vectors in any basis of V.

A trick to determine if n n-dimensional vectors are linearly independent is to calculate [the determinant](the_determinant)
