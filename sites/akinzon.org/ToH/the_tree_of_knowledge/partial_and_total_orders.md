**Partial orders** are types of relations that are [Relation Properties|reflexive and transitive](relation_properties|reflexive_and_transitive), but are also anti-symmetric, meaning that if $xRy$ and $yRx$ then $x=y$, $x$ and $y$ cannot be different values.

**Total orders** satisfy the following property: 
$$ \forall x,y.\ xRy \oplus yRx $$
