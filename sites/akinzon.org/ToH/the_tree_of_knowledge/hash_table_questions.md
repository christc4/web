What are the two ways of [Hash Collision Resolution](hash_collision_resolution)? #flashcard 
[Open Addressing](open_addressing) - using [Linear Probing|linear](linear_probing|linear) or [Quadratic Probing|quadratic](quadratic_probing|quadratic) probing to find the next available space
[Separate Chaining](separate_chaining) - storing a [Linked Lists|linked list](linked_lists|linked_list) at each index and adding collisions to the linked list

Why are dummy markers [The Importance of a Dummy Marker for Deletion|important for deletion](the_importance_of_a_dummy_marker_for_deletion|important_for_deletion) in in hash tables? #flashcard 
Dummy markers are used to check if a value has already been deleted rather than `null` entries because it is ambiguous if a `null` value is an as yet unfilled value or an entry that has been deleted.
