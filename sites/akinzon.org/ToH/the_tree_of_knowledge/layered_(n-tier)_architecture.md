In the layered architecture, different components are separated into different layers based on what they do.

Similar components of the system are grouped into the same layer.

A layer can only communicate with the one above or below it.

The [TCP IP model](tcp_ip_model) comes to mind due to its 4 layers.

Below all these layers is the underlying hardware.

**Intuition:** Imagine having to query one person, who talks to another, and so on until the last person is reached, who then sends the answer back, one person at a time.
