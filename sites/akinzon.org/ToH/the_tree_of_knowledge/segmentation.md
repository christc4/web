What is segmentation? #flashcard 
Segmentation is similar to paging, but is visible to the programmer (unlike paging)
Segmentation allows the programmer to view [RAM|memory](ram|memory) as a set of independent address spaces, with each segment having its own set of rights
Fragments of a process can therefore be modified and recompiled independent of each other
Segments can also be shared by various processes.
