TARGET DECK

It costs extra to write all those unit tests during development, but 
one benefit of that is that increases productivity!

To ensure this productivity, tests should:
	- run fast, only on small bits of code.
	- be simple, only test what it needs to.
	- be developed at the same time as the code (test code asap)

**Other benefits:**
	- Less time to write tests 
	- Early bug detection
	- Improves on design decisions
	- Enhances the test documentation
	- Encourages better code
	- Safer than leaving it till the end
