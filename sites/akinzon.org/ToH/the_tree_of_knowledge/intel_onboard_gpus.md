Only 10% of the performance of a discrete GPU,

Their market is for lower power desktops/laptops (Discrete GPUs are power-hungry!)

Good for tasks involving encoding

If onboard GPUs are so poo (blud thinks he's on the team LOL) compared to discrete GPUs, why might they be used? #flashcard 
They consume less power and may be better in low-power laptops and desktops.
