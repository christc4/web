[Branch-And-Bound Rap](branch-and-bound_rap) 

Branch-and-bound is an advanced heuristic form of [Backtracking](backtracking) where some time is saved by not branching whenever we're sure that the branch will **NEVER** lead to an optimal solution.

Some branches are effectively **pruned** from the search space.
