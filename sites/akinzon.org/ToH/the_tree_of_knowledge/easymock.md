TARGET DECK

EasyMock is an open-source tool for creating mock objects for testing.

Instead of explicitly creating [Stub Objects|stubs](stub_objects|stubs) and using them as mocks, EasyMock does all of that for you.

Think of it as creating a recording of a live event.

The created mock objects can be [Dependency Injection|injected](dependency_injection|injected) into the unit being tested and used to run the test cases you want.

These mock objects can also be configured to verify the interaction between the mock object and the unit being tested.

It's as if we put the unit being tested in a simulated environment so that we can solely focus on that unit, and nothing else.
