**Object Serialisation** is a type of serialisation that can be performed on [objects](objects).

For an object to be serialisable, it must implement the *Serializable* [Interfaces|interface](interfaces|interface).

This interface is what is known as a **tagging interface**, since it has no [methods](methods) and is only used to "tag" the class that implements it.

Serialisable objects will have their state (relevant attributes) recorded and put in a data stream.

What is a prerequisite for serialising objects? #flashcard 
It must be tagged with the *Serializable* interface first.
