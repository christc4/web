TARGET DECK

The domain of a relation $R$ is the set that contains all the $x$ terms in $x \mapsto y$. 

This is written as $dom(R)$.

$$ x \in dom(R)\ \exists y · x \mapsto y \in R $$

The range of a relation $R$ is the set that contains all the $y$ terms in $x \mapsto y$.

This is written as $ran(R)$.

$$ y \in ran(R)\ \exists x · x \mapsto y \in R $$
