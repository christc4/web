Threads can have their priorities [Mutator Methods|set](mutator_methods|set) and [Accessor Methods|accessed](accessor_methods|accessed) by the scheduler to tell it which threads should be run first.

There are three [Static Final Variables|constants](static_final_variables|constants) that can b used for thread priorities:

| Name | Description` | Value |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| `public static final int MIN_PRIORITY` | Lowest priority | 1 |
| `public static final int NORM_PRIORITY` | Medium priority (default setting) | 5 |
| `public static final int MAX_PRIORITY` | Highest priority | 10 |
