An architecture and Micro-architecture are different
- Different Instruction set architectures have different instruction sets altogether (x86 vs ARM)
- Different micro-architectures can share an instruction set (Intel Core & AMD ryzen)


What is the key difference between instruction set architectures and micro-architectures, give an example of each #flashcard 
different instruction set architectures have different instruction sets(x86 vs [ARM](arm)), but differing micro-architectures can share instruction sets(Intel Core and AMD)
