**Semantics** are the meaning of a formula.

**Truth Tables** are a nice way to represent semantics.

### Semantics definitions


**Tautologies** are propositional formulae that are always true, all possible values for its propositional variables always evaluate the statement to True - Valid

**Contradictory statements** evaluate to False for all possible values of propositional variables.

**Satisfiable formulas** - Propositional Formulae that have at least 1 assignment of propositional variables that evaluate the overall formula to True

**Logical Equivalence** - Two formulas are logically equivalent if they evaluate to the same value for the same set of propositional variable

**Semantic Entailment** - if $Γ ⊧ φ$, then any truth assignment that makes a formula in Γ evaluate to T, will also make $φ$ evaluate to T

**Proof** - if $Γ ⊦ φ$, then using the formulae in Γ can be used to prove $φ$ as the conclusion.
