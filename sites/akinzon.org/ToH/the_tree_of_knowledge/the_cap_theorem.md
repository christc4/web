**Consistency.**
Every read receives the most recent write, or an error (no outdated data read)

**Availability.**
(Every request receives a response, even if it's not the most updated data)

**Partition Tolerance.**
(The system continues to operates despite network partitions causing some nodes to go down)

**The CAP Theorem states that these three cannot coexist in perfect harmony.**

**Know the trade-offs**

[Consistency + Partition Tolerance](consistency_+_partition_tolerance)

[Availability + Partition Tolerance](availability_+_partition_tolerance)

[Consistency + Availability](consistency_+_availability)
