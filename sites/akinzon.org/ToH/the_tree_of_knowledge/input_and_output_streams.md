Modelling data as a bytestream is accurate because aside from processing data, we're always moving it from one place to another!

An advantage of this is that the same I/O interface can be used for networks, peripherals, and files.

Why is it beneficial to model data as bytestreams #flashcard 
It allows for the same interface to be used for networks, peripherals and files, since all three of them involve transmitting bytes.
