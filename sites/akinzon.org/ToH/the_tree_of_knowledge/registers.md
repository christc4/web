Registers are made of [Flip-Flops](flip-flops)

Registers are circuited used inside the CPU to store bits of data.

**Parallel Registers** are a set of 1 bit memories that can be read/written simultaneously.

**Shift registers** shift their output once every clock cycle

**General purpose registers** are used as working memory by the processor during the [Instruction cycle](instruction_cycle).

**Condition code registers** can be used by programs to affect program behaviour if certain conditions are met.

**Status registers** use each bit as a flag to signal if an error/exception has occurred or to assist in handling [interrupts](interrupts). 

**Control registers** are the special purpose registers used in the CPU during the [instruction cycle](instruction_cycle) such as the Memory Address register, which stores the location in memory of the instruction that is about to be fetched.
