Since priority queues are all about letting the highest priority be dequeued first, this is great behaviour that coincides with the behaviour of a heap. 

Heaps keep their lowest value items near the top, which we can use to represent higher priority items!

Therefore, whenever a new item is added, if it is of a higher priority (lower value), it will be percolated up the tree, just as it would be added behind higher priority items in a logical priority tree.
