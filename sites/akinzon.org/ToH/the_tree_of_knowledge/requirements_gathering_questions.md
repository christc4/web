What is meant by [Requirements Gathering](requirements_gathering), and what are the two steps involved in this? #flashcard 
Requirements gathering is the process of refining a client or project manager's idea to produce a [Models|model](models|model)/[Designing a System|design](designing_a_system|design).
We extract data from the project manager/client and document it for later.

What is meant by the scope of a system? #flashcard 
A [System Scope](system_scope) is a set of functionalities to be implemented by a system.
<!--ID: 1707767941779-->



What are the 6 means by which a scope is [Defining the Scope|defined](defining_the_scope|defined)? #flashcard 
**Need:** What problem is solved, what needs are satisfied?
**Goals:** What is the purpose of the system?
**Business Case:** How efficient/money-making is the system?
**Stakeholders:** Who/What will be affected by the system?
**High-level Operational Concepts** - How does the system work, without getting too specific?
**Success Criteria** - How can we measure the system's success?

What are the benefits of a [Why The Scope Definition Must Be Detailed|detailed scope](why_the_scope_definition_must_be_detailed|detailed_scope)? #flashcard 
It keeps the bigger picture easy to see for stakeholders, and can be referred back to later on.

How do waterfall and AGILE [scoping philosophies](scoping_philosophies) differ? #flashcard 
The traditional model has a fixed scope, and is a contract for the developers to fulfil.
In AGILE, the scope is continuously changing.

What is the difference between [Functional Requirements](functional_requirements) and [Non-Functional Requirements](non-functional_requirements)? #flashcard 
Functional requirements detail **what the system must do**, while non-functional requirements detail **how the system must do it**.
<!--ID: 1707767941819-->



What are three key [Functional Requirements](functional_requirements)? #flashcard 
What the system must do
How the system interacts with users
How the system interacts with other systems.
<!--ID: 1707767941827-->



What are three key [Non-Functional Requirements](non-functional_requirements)? #flashcard 
**Performance requirements**: How fast the system performs
**Usability requirements**: Ease of use of the system
**Adaptability requirements**: How easy the system can evolve
<!--ID: 1707767941834-->



What are three key [Design Requirements](design_requirements)? #flashcard 
**Implementation requirements:** What tools the system must use
**Interface requirements:** Constraints imposed by existing systems
**Legal requirements:** Constraints imposed by the law
<!--ID: 1707767941842-->



[What makes a good specification](what_makes_a_good_specification)? (5) #flashcard 
**Completeness:** Everything the system can do must be described, but not EVERYTHING
**Consistency:** [Requirements](requirements) should not contradict each other
**Unambiguity:** Requirements should only be able to be interpreted in one way, not in ways that contradict each other
**Verifiability:** We should be able to demonstrate the success of the system
**Traceability:** We should be able to trace the spec to the system 100% and vice versa
