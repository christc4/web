**For matrices A and B**:
	If $AB=BA=I$ (Identity), A and B are inverses of each other.

**Classic video on inverting a matrix:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obts_JDS6_Q&ab_channel=KhanAcademy

The columns of an invertible matrix are linearly independent

[The Determinant](the_determinant) determines if matrices can even be inverted.

This also means that the determinant also determines if a matrix is composed of linearly independent vectors.
