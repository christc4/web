The Cartesian Product can even be used here to find the set of outcomes of two events.

> [!TIP]- You toss a coin and a 4-sided die If the coin gives 0 (tail), we take value of zero If the coin gives 1 (head), we take the value of the 4-side die What is the probability you get a value 3?
> $\mathbb{P}(head) = \frac{1}{2}$
> $\mathbb{P}(3) = \frac{1}{4}$
> $\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{8}$
