What are Hard disks and Solid State drives? #flashcard 
[Hard Disk Drives|HDDs](hard_disk_drives|hdds) are a form of [Magnetic Storage](magnetic_storage) where the disk is covered in a magnetisable material, typically iron oxide.
[Solid State Drives|SSDs](solid_state_drives|ssds) are a form of [External Memory|external storage](external_memory|external_storage) that uses electronic circuitry built with semiconductors.

What are some advantages and disadvantages and disadvantages of HDDs and SSDs? #flashcard 
[Hard Disk Drives|HDDs](hard_disk_drives|hdds) are cheaper per byte, but can be corrupted by magnetic fields and are more susceptible to damage.
[Solid State Drives|SSDs](solid_state_drives|ssds) are faster, shock-resistant and generate less noise, but have a limited number of read/write cycles and cost more.
