In Event-B, refinement preserves **safety:** This means that properties such as invariants are kept during the refinement process since they are necessary to guarantee the safety of the system.

Furthermore, we can even use proofs for extra **verification**, to ensure that our refinements do not remove safety from the system.

If a proof fails, our refinement has been inconsistent, and we can then try and refine again!
