# History of the Computer - Vacuum tubes and Stored programs

Brother:

The first generation of computers used vacuum tubes to store memory  
  
The fundamental design approached used was theÂ **stored program concept.  
 
This approach is usually attributed to von Neumann ([von Neumann's 5 proposals for the operation of a computer|von Neumann Architecture](von_neumann's_5_proposals_for_the_operation_of_a_computer|von_neumann_architecture)),  
but can also be attributed to Alan Turing since he worked on and implemented the idea  
at the same time with his Turing Machines.
