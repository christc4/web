# Merge Sort

Up: [[O(nlog(n)) Sorting Algorithms]]

The Merge Sort is an example of a sorting algorithm that employs **divide-and-conquer:** it splits the list into halves [[Recursion|recursively]], until it is only singleton sublists, or reaches a point where [[insertion sort]] is faster and sorts those sublists.


These sublists are then merged together to form the final sorted list.
