Dégénérations, by Mes Aïeux, translated to English by David Mathewes

	Your great great grandfather cleared a little piece of land
	Your great grandfather helped to plow the field by hand
	And your grandfather took it, made it grow and made it thrive
	Then your father sold it off and took a steady nine-to-five
	 
	As for you, young man, in the city all alone
	In a one-bedroom loft winter chills you to the bone
	When you dream at night you feel the shovel in your hand
	as you walk the fields of that little piece of land

	well now Your great great grandmum She had fourteen kids to raise
	and then Your great grandmum nearly followed in her ways 
	Then your grandmother had three and decided to prevent
	And your mom had just the one and she was an accident 

	As for you, little girl, a different partner every night
	And if anything goes wrong, you go to town and put it right
	But in the silent morning you can almost hear the sound
	Of a big kitchen table all the children gathered round

	Your great grandfather's dad Was a depression-era man 
	And your grandfather's dad Counted pennies in the hand 
	And thank God, your granddad became a millionaire
	Then your dad retired early to live off of his share 

	As for you, young man, you owe your soul to uncle sam 
	You can't even get a loan, and nobody gives a damn 
	And so fight the temptation to commit armed robbery
	you read those books about how to embrace simplicity

	Your great great grandmom and dad They knew how to throw it down
	Then your great grandmom and dad went a-swinging through this town 
	And your grandmom and dad They sang twist and shout all night 
	Your mom and dad met at a disco and it was love at first sight

	As for you, my friend,  how do your evenings go?
	Can you break away from the television glow
	Some things never change under any circumstance 
	Put your new shoes on kid cos we're going out to dance!
