	Everywhere is freaks and hairies
	Dykes and fairies, tell me, where is sanity?
	Tax the rich, feed the poor
	'Til there are no rich no more
	I'd love to change the world
	But I don't know what to do
	So I'll leave it up to you
	Population keeps on breeding
	Nation bleeding, still more feeding, economy
	Life is funny, skies are sunny
	Bees make honey, who needs money? No, not poor me
	I'd love to change the world
	But I don't know what to do
	So I'll leave it up to you
	Oh, yeah
	World pollution, there's no solution
	Institution, electrocution
	Just black and white, rich or poor
	Them and us, stop the war
	I'd love to change the world
	But I don't know what to do
	So I'll leave it up to you
