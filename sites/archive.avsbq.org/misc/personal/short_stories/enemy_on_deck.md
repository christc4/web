# Enemy on deck DRAFT

Even in the fog of war a tank is visible

Before my cutlas could complete its arc, cannonfire volleyed across stormy seas.

We all heaved a bit, like little storm tossed boats.

These hour-long efforts to keep the musclebound captain at bay were fraught with such distractions.

My shaken focus, opened one too many angles for my foe and my exhaust struck face appeared on the edge of his sword.

At this rate, I'd be skewered any second now. 

His sword would rend my flesh from bone. And my head would be cast from my miserable torso and into the cold wet sea. It began to dawn on me, that isn't too bad with our current situation.

I shall tell you how I found myself in such a predicament.

We were told to stay put in pirate infested seas, like sitting ducks. At half-cast, the enemy would make an abrupt and loud ambush and my job was to ambush their captain, who would be first to enter the captain deck to seize whatever captured his eye. How I specifically wound up fit for this will never be a mystery to me. Years of showboating at naval tournaments had come back to bite me, capturing the judges eye I did indeed - and now I was captured exactly in my foe's line of sight. I am really - head and shoulders above my peers - and such a detachment is looking likely.

Also - despite being outnumbered 5 men to 1 - whatever bloodloss we experienced tonight, would have the scales tipped if we had the enemy captains head.

 this dispatchal job was nigh on impossible...

Swing! Slash!

My head being lobbed of was not part of today's plan and with our bout drawing on for this long, it became less about turning out the heroic victor and more about escaping to see another day. 

Our attacks had debarked a large portion of the walls and dust from above was seeping through in healthy doses. 

Legend goes he felled a man with one single punch. His beard was wispy and with each swing I lost ground, and that same sword that rended flesh from bone was inching closer and closer to me  

Was I to suffer the same grizzyl fate. Would it be commendable, to spend a few more seconds with the brute to savy my crewmen from his wrath.
