are you criminal maastermind

One day he had bit of more than he could chew

demonization

Not withstanding

This was all so unbecoming

A whole cloud of flies 

dregs of society

i suggest you chaannel it into 

resourceful to begin with

students using phones and tablets as computer surrogates

bewildered as to why thinggs dont work

empower

let us skip the useless pleasantries

everything  must be brought to daylight

invisiblee jew

stomach tied in knots

The unemployed milling around street corners

grease the right palm

Pushed to the fore of public notice
