# Evaluate the likely effects of an increase in protectionism on the economy of a developing country of your choice

> Since the global financial crisis of 2008 there have been over 5,700 increases in tariffs, quotas and administrative controls on international trade

A likely effect of an increase in protectionism in Uganda, are infant industries i.e. "domestic clothing" developing economices of scale. Protectionist measures, such as imposing quotas/tariffs on foreign imports i.e. "second-hand Western clothing" coould shield domestic from unintentional predatory pricing. Tariffs on cheaper second-hand clothing will create a price mark-up shifting P1 to P2. Quotas/Administrative controls reducing quantity supplied, will move Q1 to Q2. In theory, ceteris paribus, demand will chase the lower priced good i.e. "domestic Ugandan clothing" which now appear more attractive to Ugandan consumers. Therefore, Ugandan may experience economic growth such as real GDP increasing. Moreover, if domestic firms have a larger market share this may mean there are less leakages in the economy and if injections exceed leakages national output (gbp) will increase.

However, classical liberal economists may argue that an increase in protectionism may have negative effects on the Ugandan economy such as a decrease in productivity. Protectionist policies may enable inefficient firms to exiist, which couold lead to a misallocation oof scarce resources i.e. "water and cotton". Productivity may decrease if Uganda's efficiency in which capital and labour are combined produce less with the same level of output.
