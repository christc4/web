Why do interest rates affect strength of currency

Is the UK at spare or full capacity, this is svery useful in macroecoonomic

Capped prices might help control the annual rate of inflation this is because household fuel bills are a relatively weighted item in the calculation of the consumer price index. Depending on how fastt wages and earnings are rising in nominal terms, a fall in the inflation rate might lead to an increase in real disposable incomes for many households which would then contribute to an increase in real disposable income for many households which would then contribute to an increase in consumer spending on other goodss and services. 
An energy price cap might therefore contribute to increased retail sales and a faster rate of economic growth in the short term. Households mighta also be able to put a little more away each month to help build up their savings

However, although an energy price cap might lift consumer spending on goods and services, putting a ceiling on energy bills might have a negative effect on business investment which is also a component part of aggregate demand (AD=C+I+G+X-M). For example, the profit margins of energy companies are relatively low (less than 5 percent of operating cost). If their prices are capped, they might have less profit available to fund infrastructure spending to maintain and improve the energy distribution network. And lower energy prices might also reduce the profitability of investment in alternative forms of renewable energy such as off-shore wind, tidal and solar power. Some energy firms such as N-Power have announced big reductions in employment and a fall in the number of people employed in this sector could have negative multiplier effects.

However, the industry regulator OFGEM has set a price cap that is fairly high and it save the average household only around Â£75 per year. They have also said that the cap will be reviewed and changed up to two times a year depending on fluctuations in the international price of oil and gas. One might argue that the cap is an example of regulatory failure with the regulator operating mainly in the interests of oligopolistic energy suppliers rather than energy users.
