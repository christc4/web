‘In tragedy, victims suffer more than the protagonists’
In works of tragedy, such as The Great Gatsby and Richard II there exists much debate as to whether
victims suffer more than protagonists. One interpretation put forth suggests victims do suffer more than
protagonists, as their suffering is referenced continuously unlike suffering of protagonists. A secondary
reading argues protagonists suffer more as they have more at stake to lose. An alternative reading
implies the suffering of protagonists and victims are relatively hard to compare. This essay will examine
each in turn, in order to better understand implied authorial attitudes towards the suffering of
victims/protagonists, in particular to pinpoint which party suffered more.
Upon a cursory reading, it is undoubtable that protagonist, Jay Gatsby, suffers the most in The Great
Gatsby as he had more at stake to lose. Gatsby yearns to be reunited with his former lover, Daisy
Buchannan, to which he goes to great lengths to accomplish this dream. Gatsby virtually transforms his
“shapeless and shiftless farm” background to become a wealthy socialite throwing “large parties”, in
order to appeal to Daisy because of wealth. Despite his efforts, this ultimately culminates in Gatsby’s
“unutterable depression”, he cannot come to terms with Daisy being formally married to Tom and
having a daughter. Gatsby’s suffering is made paramount here, his life’s purpose as it seems, was to
reunite with Daisy, yet his efforts appear to have been wasted. A psycho-analytical reading would
suggest that this unreconcilable fact, indeed causes Gatsby continuous woe and causes him to prioritize
Daisy before himself. Gatsby reveals to Nick, “Of course, I’ll say I was driving”, Gatsby here absorbs the
suffering of Daisy onto himself, he takes full responsibility for the death of a woman, unknown to him,
all because of his love for Daisy. Therefore, it is undoubtable that Gatsby suffered the most, not only
were his life efforts and high position in 1920’s society, essentially wasted, he absorbed the suffering of
others, which led to his death. Similarly, in Richard II, we observe a similar notion. Richard is essentially
deposed from an all-powerful King to penniless prisoner. Richard laments on how people have been
essentially unable to relate to him, being King, “mistaking [him] all this while, living with bread, tasting
grief, needing friends”. From this it can be inferred, Richard’s entire life has been a suffering, due to his
subject’s inability to see him as a person, which if analyzed psychoanalytically suggests Richard feels
extreme loneliness and isolation from the world. 
Conversely, it is more plausible to argue that victims suffer more as their suffering is referenced
continuously. Victims, such as Wilson are first referred to as “spiritless” and “anaemic”. At face-value,
suffering can only be deduced by the sickly and mundane description provided by Nick. However, a
Marxist reading infers that his “anaemic” description is a telltale sign of sickness induced by poor
working conditions, a typical experience of the working classes in 1920s N.America. Moreover, the
superlative adjective “spiritless” perhaps reveals the monotony of Wilson’s line of work, he neither
experiences the lavish lifestyles of the Buchannan's or Gatsby yet works long hours yet works long
manual hours. Moreover, although not mentioned continuously and to the same extent, characters such
as Mowbray, suffer greatly – having to forgo “the language learnt from 40 years” and having made his
“tongue [no longer useful] to [him] no more”. Mowbray, claims his physical banishment from England, is
banishment from his language, which essentially strips him of freedom, he can no longer communicate
with his countrymen.
On the other hand, suffering is rather difficult to compare between parties. The economic suffering
England faces, after the coffers have been emptied for Irish wars and the challenges facing the working
classes of 1920’s USA are relatively difficult to compare with the emotional sufferings of Richard and
Gatsby. A Marxist critique would argue that the economic suffering is unjust and involves more
suffering, due to class exploitation, whereas a psycho-analytical argument may argue the emotional
distress of Richard being deposed King, which he believes to be his divine right and Gatsby losing the
love of his life, are far more significant due to the depression it causes. Moreover, although The Great
Gatsby clearly highlights the suffering of Wilson, we as readers do not learn of the suffering of victims
from Gatsby and Wolfsheim's illicit operations, or the causalities of the Irish wars.
In summation, whether protagonists suffer more than victim in tragedy very much depends on the
perspective each text is viewed from. A Marxist reading would consider the unmentioned victims
alongside the economically challenged, as suffering more due to class exploitation. Yet on the reverse, a
psycho-analytical reading would justify the notion protagonists suffer more, due to the mental stress
each protagonists faces. Therefore, it is impossible to give a definitive answer, without deferring back to
each reading
