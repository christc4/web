L’Etranger (The Outsider/Stranger/Foreigner) is the story Meursault, a man who, after
attending his mother’s funeral, kills an Arab man – a terrible crime he seems to feel very
little about. In this scene, he is in court, waiting in the dock to hear the verdict and sentence.
The court rose, and the lawyer sat down, looking thoroughly exhausted. Some of his
colleagues came to him and shook his hand. “You put up a magnificent show, old man,” I
heard one of them say. Another lawyer even called me to witness: “Fine, wasn’t it?” I
agreed, but insincerely; I was far too tired to judge if it had been “fine” or otherwise.
Meanwhile the day was ending and the heat becoming less intense. By some vague sounds
that reached me from the street I knew that the cool of the evening had set in. We all sat
on, waiting. And what we all were waiting for really concerned nobody but me. I looked
round the courtroom. It was exactly as it had been on the first day. I met the eyes of the
journalist in gray and the robot woman. This reminded me that not once during the whole
hearing had I tried to catch Marie’s eye. It wasn’t that I’d forgotten her; only I was too
preoccupied. I saw her now, seated between Céleste and Raymond. She gave me a little
wave of her hand, as if to say, “At last!” She was smiling, but I could tell that she was rather
anxious. But my heart seemed turned to stone, and I couldn’t even return her smile.
The judges came back to their seats. Someone read out to the jury, very rapidly, a string of
questions. I caught a word here and there. “Murder of malice aforethought ... Provocation
... Extenuating circumstances.” The jury went out, and I was taken to the little room where I
had already waited. My lawyer came to see me; he was very talkative and showed more
cordiality and confidence than ever before. He assured me that all would go well and I’d get
off with a few years’ imprisonment or transportation. I asked him what were the chances of
getting the sentence quashed. He said there was no chance of that. He had not raised any
point of law, as this was apt to prejudice the jury. And it was difficult to get a judgment
quashed except on technical grounds. I saw his point, and agreed. Looking at the matter
dispassionately, I shared his view. Otherwise there would be no end to litigation. “In any
case,” the lawyer said, “you can appeal in the ordinary way. But I’m convinced the verdict
will be favorable.”
We waited for quite a while, a good three quarters of an hour, I should say. Then a bell rang.
My lawyer left me, saying: 
“The foreman of the jury will read out the answers. You will be called on after that to hear
the judgment.”
Some doors banged. I heard people hurrying down flights of steps, but couldn’t tell whether
they were near by or distant. Then I heard a voice droning away in the courtroom.
When the bell rang again and I stepped back into the dock, the silence of the courtroom
closed in round me, and with the silence came a queer sensation when I noticed that, for
the first time, the young journalist kept his eyes averted. I didn’t look in Marie’s direction. In
fact, I had no time to look, as the presiding judge had already started pronouncing a
rigmarole to the effect that “in the name of the French people” I was to be decapitated in
some public place. It seemed to me then that I could interpret the look on the faces of those
present; it was one of almost respectful sympathy. The policemen, too, handled me very
gently. The lawyer placed his hand on my wrist. I had stopped thinking altogether. I heard
the Judge’s voice asking if I had anything more to say. After thinking for a moment, I
answered, “No.” Then the policemen led me ou

The extract is focalized inside a courtroom in which a man, who has
committed murder, waits to her the verdict and sentence for his crime.
Consequently, the crime elements found include the: legal system, crime
committed and victimhood. This essay will examine each in turn in order to
understand Camus’ implied attitude towards the justice system in which he
wrote, and the differential treatment criminals could face based on their
victims.
Upon first reading, the most convincing element of crime is the legal
system in Meursault. The legal system offers leniency to murder through
the strength of one's legal team. As the court appears to take break a
lawyer can be heard saying to his colleague “you put up a magnificent
show, old man”. The declarative sentence, featuring a superlative adjective,
suggests the criminal’s lawyers have achieved relative success in court,
which indicates their legal strength. In addition, the use of ordinary
language suggests a state of relaxedness implying the lawyers are not
stressed by the judicial system, insinuating the notion their team can
achieve leniency for the criminal. Secondly, legal strength is further
indicative through a lawyer “[who is] more confident than ever before” and
assures the criminal that “all would go well”. The use of intensifier and
speculative phrase further solidifies the notion that the strong legal team
will achieve leniency for the verdict and sentence. Furthermore, another
lawyer begins commenting how the criminal can “get off with a few years
imprisonment”. The determiner “few” affirms the notion leniency can be
achieved through a lessened prison sentence. Moreover, the heavy use of
casual language and self-assuredness of the lawyer's speech implies;
providing a strong legal team is present, murderers may face leniency by
the judicial system through “few years [in prison]”.
From a different perspective, another element of crime is the status of
victims. A lawyer is “convinced” that the verdict will be “favorable” this may
be the author implying differential treatment due to the ethnicity of
victimhood. Perhaps farfetched, it is important to consider the date in which
the novel was written, 1942, a period in which the status of Arabs living
under French rule led to them often being deemed as second-class
citizens. Therefore, this interpretation gains plausibility as it can be inferred 
the lawyers are aware of the differential treatment the criminal will receive.
This is further insinuated through the announcement of “In the name of the
French people” which creates an insider versus outsider atmosphere, in
which there can be an implied distinction between the Arab victim and
French criminal. Moreover, this perhaps suggest the legal system in
Meursault acts on the behalf of French people first and foremost suggesting
there is racial bias. The faces of “respectful sympathy” and “gentle
handling” by police are indicative of society’s attitudes towards victims of
non-French origin; detached and apathetic.
In conclusion, the most significant element of crime is victimhood. Although
the extract heavily hints on the strength of the criminals legal team it cannot
be denied that existing societal attitudes and differential treatment of Arabs
during the authors time of writing were not a heavy influence on the courts
course of procedure.
