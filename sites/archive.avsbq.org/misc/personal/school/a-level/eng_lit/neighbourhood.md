A crime in the neighborhood explores faults in policing, commentates on societies attitudes towards
disappearances and places emphasis on the age of victims of crime. One interpretation is that Berne,
through the inability of the police to act swiftly, implies the police force lack interest in pursuing crime.
Another reading is that the emphasis on the victim’s age is highlighting the vulnerability of child-victims
in relation to crime. A final viewpoint is that, Berne is commentating on society, as they see only
express interest in crime for its entertainment value. This essay will consider these interpretations and
conclude on which is most significant.
Faults in policing are clear through how the police are unable to act before “24 hours”. A civilian “grown
man” takes measures into his own hands, “running and banging on doors”. The intensifier adverb
“banging” may imply desperation if he does not act swift something tragic may happen. Moreover, his
“zigzagging and hardly pausing” suggests the civilian better understands the severity of the childs
predicament better than the police force, as he wastes no time in alerting every resident. Indeed, this
notion is picked up by the fact the police “couldn’t do anything”. The pronoun “anything” encapsulates
the purposeless and ineffectual nature of the police. Indeed, affirmed by the narrator who says “that
was the police for you”. On a wider sense, this can be read to suggest the author is commentating on a
real-world flaw in police handling; as the 24-hour time delay may provide sufficient means for criminals
to avoid detection and possibly for a “disappearance” to escalate. Alternatively, the image of a lone
civilian in contrast to a police force unable to act, could perpetuate the idea that civilians despite not
having “rope ladders and dogs” are more effective than a police force and that they prioritize the
significance of a “childs disappearance” whereas the police force do not.
The emphasis on the victim’s age, indeed captures the vulnerability of the child in relation to crime.
Initially, the victim is referred to as “boy”, yet in the same paragraph and further in the extract this is to
be substituted for “child”. The inclusivity of this noun, may purport the idea that this could be any
person’s child, capturing the vulnerability of childhood in relation to kidnapping. Moreover, the use of
anaphora in, “A child is missing. A child is missing” and the positioning of “child” at the beginning places
further emphasis on the child’s age, accentuating the idea by going “missing” he is at danger or risk.
A final plausible viewpoint is that Berne is commentating on society, who treat a disappearance as a
spectacle, a source of entertainment. Although on the surface, “tensely” coupled with “excited”
suggests that the residents are invested into the outcome of the news, in regard to the child's safety.
The plausibility of this quickly diminishes as the narrator notes they “also hoped the boy wouldn’t be
found” this encapsulates the lack of concern for the boy’s safety. Suggesting, a main reason why they
are tuned into the news is only to see a “dramatic rescue” which signifies lack of genuine concern
towards the boys wellbeing.
In conclusion, the most significant element of crime are societal attitudes, this novelized version of
society is deeply hypocritical, expressing dissatisfaction at the inability of police to act yet hoping to see
“rope ladders and dogs”. Perhaps the author is attempting to draw parallels to the real world, in how
invested we are in murder, mystery and solving the crime instead of the victim's wellbeing and first and
foremost their safety.
