	Commentary, this answer is largely factual, the only place where it becomes evaluative is in the final sentence, but it is basic. 

There are more than seven billion mobile phones more than one per person by having a mobie phone, people may experience "shrinking world effect" and become more globalised, However many mobile users such as those in North Korea do not have full access to the internet and are excluded from external influences. So in some places mobile phone growth may not necessarily be linked with globalisation. 
	
	Commentary, as in the previous answer the first sentence is factual, the rest of the paragraph is evaluative.

There are more than seven billion mobile phones more than one per person. By having a mobile phone, people may experience the shrinking world effect and become more globalised. However many mobile users such as those in North Korea, do not have full access to the internet and are excluded from external influences. So in some places mobile phone growth may not necessarily be linked with globalisation.

	Commentary, this paragraph is entirely factual, Titile "the causes of climate change and current global warming are differnet" How far do you agree with this statement

There are differences between past climate change and current global warming. Past climate change was due to changes in the Earths orbit from circular to elliptical. This changed the amount of sunlight received. Current global warming is said to be due to the emission of greenhouse gases, such as methane and carbon dioxide caused by deforestation and the burning of fossil fuels. This is called the enhanched greenhouse effect.

	Commentary, the first and third sentences are factual. The remainder is evaluative

There are differences between past climate change and current global warming. This reflects the debate between natural causes and human causes. Natural causes included Milankovitch cycles, changes of the Earths orbit, and volcanic eruptions. Human causes are associated with fossil fuel emissions and deforestation and are much more recent and rapid. Past climate change was cyclical whereas recent global warming is due to unsustainable human activity.

	Commentary, this paragraph is entirely factual. Having, said that, the final clause seems rather unlikely in terms of the numbers involved. It is typical of many students who seek to impress by using speculative facts.

TNCs such as McDonalds have spread around the world on account of globalisation. Their power is enormous and they can be found in any city, although often they change the ingredients they use, such as the McArabia burger, which is available in Middle East countries. This is called glocalisation. Often. the menus are written in English and its estimated that because of this three thousand world languages will soon be lost out of six thousand.

	Commentary, this paragraph is entirely evaluative. The language may be a little exaggerated, threatened cultural imperialism, but the underlying ideas are acceptable

TNCs like McDonalds can be found in almost every country in the world, with the effect that city centres begin to look the same wherever you are called clone towns. This is yet another way in which national identity can be threatend as places no longer look as individual. The spread of English as part of cultural imperialism is another way in which nations lose their sense of identity. Some languages become lost and so a key part of a countrys culture is no longer as distinctive

	This targets writing conclusions.

Good conclusions acknowledge that any conclusions reached is likely to be partial because there are many ways about thinking about issues, and or many perspectives to consider. It should refer to the most significant facts which may have featured in the main body of the essay in support of an evidence based final judgement. It may refer to specialist geographical theories, terms or ideas in order to add "weight" to the final judgement. Finally it may establish connections between different ideas and themes that are featured in the essay.

	Commentary. An overview of the argument is provided in the first sentence a single counterargument has been provided the role of technology adding some breadth to the argument. Globalisation is mainly driven by the actions of transnational corporations.

Having looked at both sides of the question, on balance I believe than nowadays TNCs are the powerful force driving globalisation. They have more money than many poor countries and can make their products profitable in almost any country by using globalisation, as this essay has shown. However, technolology is important too, especially the internet, so it is not just TNCs that are important in making globalisation happen.

	Commentary, an overall assessment is provided in the final sentence. However the preceding sentences flag up that the argument has recognised that there is not a single definition of globalisation, economic social political and one can infer that these have been examined in turn.

In conclusion, TNCs act alongside other forces. I certainly do not agree that TNCs drive politcal globalisation, this is more likely the work of bodies such as the UN, EU and IMF. Furthermore, powerful governments like the USA have driven geopolitical changes that make it easier for their own TNCs to promote economic globalisation e.g facebook. So while the statement may be largely true for economic globalisation. I have shown that other forces are driving different aspects of globalisation. 

	
	Commentary, a vague conclusion that points to human factors driving change in water balance. There seems to be no acknowledgement of any other factors. Similarly, the impacts of these changes are difficult to decipher.

To conclude, generally the water balance of the Amazon is changing such that water is being lost from the system mainly due to human factors. Increased population has led to increased demand for resources putting a strain on our natural planet mostly felt by fragile environments such as the rainforest.

	Commentary, a stronger conclusion that points to two main causal factors, deforestatiation and climate change, with some clear reference to impacts on the water cycle. Furthermore. the final clause suggests a link between the two main themes.

	Assess the impact of TNCs on creating both winners and losers for people and environments. Rewrite this question

Maybe use the english style paragraph, SEEP

Transnational corporations are firms with operations, producing and sourcing goods, internationally, marketing them worldwide. TNC's including but not limited to Apple and McDonalds are major players in the global economy, the top 500 TNCs account for 70% of world trade and generate a large proportion of all FDI.

A clear set of 'winners' are therefore the owners and shareholders of the companies themselves, as well as the country of origin. For example, Apple contributes over $300 billion to the US economy, and is thought to add up to a third of one percentage point to the whole USA gdp. Other winners and software design. Moreover, there are people employed in component factories, retail outlets, including online and call centres. One estimate of the total number of Apple-dependent employees in the USA is over half a million workers.

Similarly, TNCs employ millions of people in outsourced and off-shored work around the world, but theyse are often paid far less than their counterparts in countries of origin - the USA, UK etc. In China, Apple has helped raise overall living standards by employing people, leading cities like Zhengzhou to be dubbed 'iphone city' and giving the 'growing middle classes' higher disposable incomes and more consumer choice over luxury goods. As a result, extreme poverty rate in China has fallen from 84% in 1980 to 10% in 2016. However, Apple has been accused of creating sweatshop conditions. In 2006, there were reports of 200,000 workers living/working in the Shenzhen factory, working 60 hours a week for 100 dollars a month. Suicides, have also been reported to severe working conditoins, giving Apple a 'bad press'. These latter people are clearly losers, 

Environmentally, there are also winners and losers. Large energy and mineral extraciton corporations such as the Rio Tinto Zinc have especially poor environmental reputations for the devestatoin they bring to often pristine environments. Similarly the TNC shell hsa been asccused of severly damaging the environments in the Canadian Tar sands, as they exploit the oil shales there. THe dakmage that has been done is to pollute rivers, contaminate water supplies and destroy wildlife habitats.

Returning to Apple, they state that all of their US facilities, including offices, retail stores and data centers, are powered by 100% renewable energy sources like solar, wind and micro-hydro power, which Apple generates or purchases from local-projects winners. However, overseas they have received criticism from the group greenpeace. They state that Apple uses toxic chemicals (PVC and brominated flame retardants) in their manufacturing process. Also, waste from electronic components not only pollutes waterways, e-waste often ends up in landfills, contaminating communities & spreading illness. Affected people are losers.

In conclusion, it is fair to say the role of TNCs within the global is highly significant, they have created a whole series of 'winners' and 'losers' though the perception of those depends on the observer. In general they have created lots of employment for a variety of people around the world, with some benefitting more than others. Similarly, they have created a range of environmental impacts, perhaps more problematic than benefiical overall.

Assess the methods used in local communities to reduce the impact of globalisation on the environment. (12)

Globalisation has created a number of negative impacts on the physical environment such as dereliction, contaminated land, and pollution of the air and oceans. Consequently, there have been a number of responses to the environmental issues caused. One key response in developed countries has been the move by many local communities to generate ‘localism’. This is the idea that food and goods should be grown and made locally, which then supports local jobs and reduces transport movement.

The practice of recycling is now widespread in most local communities. Local councils in the UK play a key role in reducing waste and ecological footprints through recycling and councils’ waste collection services. Recycling of household waste increased from 44% to 60% between 2013 and 2018 but this was still some way behind the 80% achieved in Germany. Recycling does reduce waste, but different councils have different schemes with different results and so reducing packaging at the outset might be a better way forward.

Another local initiative is that of Transition Towns. Transition Towns were founded in 2006 by the non-governmental organisation (NGO) ‘Transition Network’. This encourages towns to grow their own food in community gardens (and hence not import it) and reduce energy used in transport, e.g. cycling and recycle waste/reuse materials. Some towns like Totnes, Exeter and Stroud even have their own local currencies to encourage local trade. These initiatives are small scale, but some elements like ‘grow your own’ could have a big impact if widely adopted and promoting local sourcing became more widespread.

There has also been the growth of ethical consumption schemes. For example, in the UK, the FSC (Forest Stewardship Council) uses its FSC logo on wood products that are sourced from sustainable forests thus helping consumers ensure that products are not contributing to environmental degradation. FSC’s criteria include that forestry must respect the land rights of indigenous people and that forestry workers are well treated and paid.

Finally, at a global scale, there is the concept of Fair trade, rather than free trade, which pays local farmers of cocoa, cotton, tea and coffee in developing countries a guaranteed price for their produce plus a ‘fair trade premium’ payment. This attempts to reduce the inequalities of global trade. The aim is to make incomes more sustainable for farming families and use some of the additional money to support community facilities like wells, schools and clinics. The downsides of fair trade are that the extra income is small, and Fairtrade products are more expensive for consumers, who are mainly in the developed world.

In conclusion, local community responses can form part of an attempt for a more ‘green’ lifestyle. In some cases, local scale initiatives have been taken up by national and supra-national governments, as with recycling and the EU. There is one big disadvantage though – producing and buying local may improve the local environment, but it is still the case that many farmers in the developing world depend on exporting their products to the developed world for their livelihoods.

Autumn 2020

Study Figure 1 which shows the relationship between GDP per capita and GII (gender inequality index). Assess the extent to which improvements in gender equality may lead to higher national incomes per capita. (12)

The Gender Inequality Index (GII) combines measures of the reproductive health of women, their participation in the workforce and empowerment (e.g. women in higher education and politics) to indicate gender aspects of development. Views differ on the validity of gender inequality as a development measure, but it is given here in a scatter graph with GDP per capita.

The graph in Figure 1 shows an inverse relationship between GDP per capita and increasing inequality. So, this means that as a country becomes richer in terms of its GDP per capita, then inequalities according to the GII decrease. An alternative way of saying this is that as the opportunities available to women in a country increase, then the chances of GDP per capita increasing also improve.

As explained above, one key element of the GII is raising the education standards of women and girls. It is a well-known fact that as education levels of females increase, then they are more likely to take control of their fertility, and birth rates fall. This is due to more women taking up places in the workforce and aspiring to better standards of living. Furthermore, as more women enter the workforce, then tax revenues for the whole country increase, again making it more likely that national GDP rates will increase. Looking at Figure 1, the countries with the lowest GDP per capita are the ones with highest level of GII inequality – Afghanistan and Kenya. The former is still regarded as a very backward society when it comes to the rights of women, many people still having the views of the outdated Taliban.

The reproductive health of women is closely linked to levels of education as explained above. With higher incomes, women are more likely to buy or make use of contraception from a younger age, and be more aware of the opportunities available to them. They also will be aware that maternal mortality can be high if childbearing begins too early, and hence the reproductive health of women is improved from that of more traditional attitudes.

It is interesting to note that China is an outlier on the graph, in the sense that levels of female inequality are relatively low compared to the level of GDP. China is a socialist country where equality as a concept is more prevalent. However, it is also the case that many factories in China make use of cheap female labour in sweatshops, so perhaps this is anomaly requires more consideration.

A third element of the GII is political empowerment. Once again, as more women enter the decision-making aspects of society, then GDP per capita rates increase. Although none of New Zealand, Finland and Germany are named on Figure 1, they do all share two characteristics – high GDP per capita indicating high standards of living, and female leaders e.g. Angela Merkel and Jacinda Ardern. But, this is more than just heads of government – when women take more control of day-to-day life in communities and small farms and workshops, it is the case that there is less waste, and greater efficiency of output. Standards of living increase not just nationally, but also in local communities.

A recent report from Oxfam stated that the wealth of the world’s richest 1% of people is equivalent to the wealth of the other 99%. This degree of income inequality is not new, but it may have become starker in the last few decades. It is hoped that as the GII improves in each country across the world, then the global gender gap will reduce, and national incomes per capita increase.
