Introduction

In September 2017 the football team Huddersfield Town, newly-promoted then to the Premier League, entertained Tottenham Hotspur. The game was shown live on television to 156 countries. Recognising that not many people around the world would have known much about the town, let alone heard of it, the football club issued a card to commentators explaining what was unique about the town. The card is shown in Figure A.

Interestingly, the card features first how the town is connected to the media – television and film. The latest actor playing Dr Who, Jodie Whittaker, and Sir Patrick Stewart (Jean-Luc Picard in the Star Trek movies) are at the top of the card – they were both born in the wider town district. Further down there are references to television programmes shot in and around the town – League of Gentlemen and Last of the Summer Wine. Other aspects feature, one in a sporting sense (Rugby League), one in a political sense (Harold Wilson) and other quite obscure features (for example, the biggest Nodding Dog). The reference to DB (David Brown) supercars and tractors connects with the author – his father worked in one of the factories there.

Representation

The card illustrates perfectly the concept of representation – defined as relating ‘to how humans perceive, engage with and form attachments to the world. This might be the everyday meanings that humans attach to places bound up with a sense of identity and belonging. It also extends to ways that meanings of place might be created, such as through place making and marketing’ (ALCAB, July 2014).

Representation is shown in the ways by which meanings are given to our world. We try to understand the world around us by describing it in ways that make sense to us. This is influenced by our perceptions, which in turn are moulded by factors such as our age, gender, ethnicity, sexuality, physical (dis)ability and educational experiences. The ways we represent (literally re-present) the world are also strongly influenced by the culture we have grown up in. A teenager based in a developed world urban setting will represent the world differently from a teenager from a rural environment in the developing world but equally gender, race, class and other factors influence our understandings of the world around us. Representations of place can include prose, pictures, architecture, and landscapes – in fact anything humans have had an influence on.

Advertising

Representation is strongly influenced by our imagination. Several advertising agencies make use of our imagination to influence how we see a place. These combine visual and written imagery to enhance the settings of a place. For example, tourist boards may select aspects that may fit a desired perception of that place. In the recent past it was common to see images in railway and bus stations and on trains, enticing people to visit certain destinations with a somewhat stylised projection of the landscape and life in such places (Figure B).

An advertisement will try to transport you somewhere else in space and time, sometimes to a past and distant world where the natural value of the place is somewhat fanciful, yet touch-able. But, do the representations of places by such media match the direct experiences of people who live there?

As illustrated in Figure A, representation can be informal, but still powerful. Other forms of media - novels, poems, songs, the visual arts, television, film, video, photography - ‘bring alive’ different places. In these cases we may struggle to match the fiction with the factual.

Some aspects of social media including blogs and even graffiti present highly individual representations of place, being strongly influenced by perceptions. Some of us attach ourselves strongly to these, perhaps because they reinforce our own attachments to a place, and we don’t want to be deflected from them.

Music, film, books and TV have often saddled a variety of places with some powerful stereotypes. Indeed it can be argued that there is a symbiotic relationship between some media and place. This can be illustrated by a variety of examples – the ITV series Downton Abbey and the USA HBO series Game of Thrones are both extremely popular and integrally linked to place. The impact of television on the tourist prospects of several locations can be highlighted – for example the impact of programmes such as Inspector Morse, Broadchurch and Doc Martin on their respective locations of Oxford, Dorset and Cornwall.

The connection between representation of place and the media is not always beneficial. The production Game of Thrones has been cited as a key factor behind the significant growth in annual visitors to Iceland, from 459,000 in 2010, the year before it was first broadcast, to an estimated 1.5 million in 2016. In 2016, there were more American visitors than local people living in the capital Reykjavik (330,000). There are now proposals to either limit the numbers of tourists to Iceland, or to impose a ‘tourist tax’ to pay for the damage Icelanders say that tourists are causing.

Conclusion

The media saturate the social spaces of many people around the world with various representations of places and landscapes. As geographers, we try to make sense of this complex set of information. We also need to consider the implications of the way places and people are represented and the ways in which those representations have significance in our lives and those of others. Many social relationships involve discussions of the media. Some are initially built upon a shared interest in a television programme, film or book. Others draw upon the media as one of the resources for creating the character of the places. This is a very personal area of study – which makes it all the more interesting.

Activities

1. The songwriters Lennon and McCartney wrote the song ‘In my life’. Here is an extract from the lyrics:

‘There are places I remember, all my life, though some have changed. Some forever, not for better, some have gone and some remain.’

Reflect on what your place, or other places you have visited, means to you.

2. What constitutes a ‘home’ to you, and how would you explain or represent that view to others?

3. Identity 5 characteristics of your place that could be used on a commentator’s card.

4. Places are represented from within and from outside.  The example here is trying to create an alternative representation of Huddersfield from the one that Huddersfield Town suspect will be most commonly held by the commentators.  Think of a ‘place’ that you know well (e.g. a city or region).  Think about how it is represented by people who live and work there.  Think about how others might represent that place.  How do these representations differ?  Why might that be the case?  How are both of these representations different or similar to place marketing activities for that place?
