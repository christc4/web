Developments ini transport technology have undoubatbly palyed a hugely significant role in the post-war acceleration of globalisation. Containerisation has allowed efficient and quick movement of goods through multiple modes of transport. This increased ease and cost has led to increasing volumes of trade and permitted lengthyand complex supply chans that are central to the vast clobal reach of tncs, highlighting the the impact on economic interdependence. The arrival of the jet aircraft has increased the affordability of air travel. This has allowed TNCs to operate more easily across national borders and eased the movement of migrant workers, but also increased toursim numbers leading to higher numbers of cultural exchanges.Other factors have orked in tandem to enable the benefits of transport technology development. For example, the wto are responsible for the global economic  archiecture which promotes the free trade that containerisation and tnc's benefit from. Similarly, communication technology developments such as online conferencing and integrated ICT manganment systems have allowed global production, particularly 'just in time' sytems to operate across larger and larger scales therefore benefittingn from economies of scale. Transport technologies have certainly been important to a lrgge extent, however they have relied on other factors and their sifnifcantce may decline in the future as the value focus shifts to data as opposed to goods, the spatial reach of TNCS

Globalisation, with TNC's being footloose you can say that they leave places beyond recognition, multinational companies may have built factories increasing employment and improviing local infrastructure, deindustrialisation could have caused factories to close, leaving derelict unused buildings for squatting, yet in rusholme in the 1960s

experienced places vs media places

the character of a place might be linked to the natural environment but usually it is a combination of the natural and human features and the people who occupy the place, these are endogenous factorss, the internal factors which shape a place's character,

Socio economic factors such as employment opportunities, crime rates, local clubs, income

Cultural factors such as heritage, religion and language

Mobility of the population for work and leisure pursuits 

Political factors such as the role and strength of local councils and resident groups 

the built environment land use age and type of housing denssity building materials

location, urban or rural, proximity toother settlements main roads and other physical features such as rivers, the coast etc.

Demographic factors, population size and structure

Physical structure, such as relief, altitude, aspect, drainage soil and rock type

## Decisions of multinational corporations

- Demographically: large number of migrants (national and international) leading to a growth in population or closure causes population decline

- Socially: investment can reduce deprivation, but if it declines it can increase crime rates - e.g. loss of car industry in Detroit

- Economically - large number of jobs created leading to the multiplier effect as employment benefits local economy, may have higher wages

Yifu Tuan suggested attachment to place grows stronger over time, more experiences you have in a place, more likely you are to be attached to that place , experiences hold different levels of intensity, greater the intensity, number of experiences, you have in a place, the greater the depth of attachment you may have to a place. 

Topopholia concerns the love of a place, topophobia is the dislike of a place, it may be possible to experience topophobia and still have a strong attachment with a place 

Media sources can change the subjective emotional attachment to a place.

Genius loci is the spirit of a place, it suggests that every place has a unique spirit or atmopseher based on everythinf for the location is made up of now and iin the past
