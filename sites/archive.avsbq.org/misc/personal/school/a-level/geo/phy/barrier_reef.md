# The Great Barrier Reef

Save the reef campaign was successsful in 1967 to 1975.

Increases in sedimentation and nutrients may result in a biodiversity loss by promoting algae growth, this reduces the amount of light available for coral seagrass and benthic organisms.

> Benthic, means organisms at the bottom of an ocean
> Turbitity, cloudy or opaque water

Said increases may occour from: sheet erosion, rill and gully erosion, bank erosion, road and fence erossion and sub surface erosion (pipping).

Although in 2020, Sussan Ley has  rejected an applicationo for almost 2000 hectares of land-clearing in the Great  Barrier Reef catchment, legallly 500 hectares of land were cleared prior to 206, however the future is uncertain.

However it is now thought that risks from land clearing can be managed if ensuring land clearing was restricted to areas with gradients less than 2 percent.

The draft recommendation imposes conditions uncluding keeping a buffer of vegetation around waterways and maintaining 50 percent native vegetation fround cover and building contours to manage water flows during the rainy season.

Adani coal mine will generate an estimated 4.7 billion tonnes of carbon pollution over its lifetime.

This mine would drive massive industriall port expansion along the reef coastrine at abboto point, over a million cubic metres of seafloor would be dredged for a new coal terminal which would threaten the habitat of vulnerable dugongs, turtles and dolphins. There would be hundreds more coal ships ploughing through the reefs waters every year, increasing the risk of accidents.

# 'Outlook report summary'

In 2009, the reef was considered to be 'at a crossroads' between a positive well-managed future and a less certain one. 2014 sam it as an 'icon under pressure' and experiencned further deterioration, requires mitigation of climate change and effective implementation of the reef 2050 plan.

Gradual sea temperature increases, such as marine heat waves, caused successive mass scale bleaching events, whuch led to widespread coral loss, flow on effects to fish and invertebarate communities. 

Most importantly, the *rate of reduction to pollutant loads* is low.

Some stakeholders want to take care of spectacular scenery for profits only

There is a *universal value* of 'world heritage areas' yet given the *global scale of human-induced climate change* the size of the property is becoming a less effective buffer to broadscale anad cumulative impacts. Attributes such as the particular scenery, significant economic resource, commercial marine tourism, fishing are heavily dependent on a functioning ecosystem.

On balance, challanges are large but not insurmountable. Iniative can halt and reverse effects of climate change at a global level, however at the present day global cooperation seems a sisyphean task.
