## Bug 1

If after initialising bq, the first input is "text" and not a bq command, then the text is inserted at the top of a line - as opposed to the end of the line. 

## Bug 2

If file not present, then an error message is shown regarding 'last edited' - this is an easy fix, says no such file or directory
