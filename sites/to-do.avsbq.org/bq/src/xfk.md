# How does xfk work

Considering hand positioning for dvorak, everything on other side of pipe is my rewrite

s jumps to beginning of new paragraph, 
d goes to the end of previous paragraph
q cuts entire line | a
. deletes a word 
	does comma delete whitespace or...?

e deletes one character | position seems good, but q seems to far down

how is everyone
