Dear Christ,

Consider the passage from scripture the next time you stumble, fthe fear of the lord is the beginning of all knowledge. Consider, the servering acts you have entertained, how it has wounded your sould and left it vulnerable to the evil one. Remember the book and age we live in. Rember that we are men, fallible indeed but men. Remember that we are Christian. Did you exhausrt all possible options? Did Christ not exhaust himself on the cross? If you wish to bewalk forever estranged from your father, see it fot for you to be damned. Consider , it was Christ who healed yhou and Christ who loves you. Remember that men an only heal what men know, and we are weak in flesh. Therefore strethen the spirit be taught thy cross and statues.
