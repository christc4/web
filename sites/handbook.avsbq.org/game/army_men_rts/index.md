All infantry units (except the Radio Operatior) are made from the Barracks

### Grunt

*COST*: 50 

*HP*: 200

*DAMAGE*: 8

*RATE OF FIRE*: 1 shot a second

Basicmost infantry, charges target and attacks continuously with rifle fire, be iit enemy infantry, armoured vehicles or air targets.

En Masse, Grunts are a formidable opponent, due to the fact that they can be manufactured so quickly and cheaply, you can resort to simply overwhelming enemy defenses with sheer numbers, they might kill some of you, but they can't kill all of you. (Unless they have splash damage... whoops). Grunts are best being early game rushers, meat shields for Advanced Infantry or as supporting infantry for Tanks.

### Sarge

If there's any last man standing that can turn the tide of a war - it's Sarge.

Don't let him die.

### Mortar men

Only attack structures, not enemy-units

### Dumdum

<img src=".pix/dumdum.avif" style="width:150px; height: auto;">

Dumdum is a robotic jih&ast;di! Keep him at corners to surprise any enemies - far more effective than laying mines - also send him to charge at watchtowers but maybe send some disposable units ahead to take the heat of him and his HP.
