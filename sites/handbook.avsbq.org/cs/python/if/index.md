# Ifs

Example

    leaves = 0

    if leaves == 0:
        print("It must be winter - or a dead tree")


The `if` keyword tells Python we want coded executed conditionally

`leaves == 0:`  is the conditional expression, if evaluated to be true, then the block of code afterwards will be run, `==` is a comparison operator
