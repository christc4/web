Create and print a dictionary

dictionary = {
    "brand": "Ford",
    "model": "Mustang",
    "year": 1964
}
print(dictionary)

## Note

We uses braces `{` and `}` to tell Python that this is a dictionary

We use `,` to seperate pairs

We use colons `:` to seperate keys and values

## Dictionary items

Dic. items are ordered, changeable, and do not allow duplicates

Dictionary items are presenteed in key:value pairs, and can be referred to by using the key name
