The `return` keyword is to exit a function and return a value

    def myfunction():
        return 3+3
    print(myfunction())

Statement's after the return line won't be executed

When you call a function some space gets allocated to it in RAM, when you compute the value of numbers that value will only exist while the function is still running, when the function gets deleted, most things in RAM such as integers get deleted
