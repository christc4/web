	let mapleader=" " " 
	set clipboard=unnamedplus
	set ttyfast 

	autocmd BufWinLeave *.* mkview " Save Folds
	autocmd BufWinEnter *.* silent loadview " View Folds

	map <leader>c :w! \| !compiler "%:p"<CR>
	map <leader>p :!opout "%:p"<CR>

	map <leader>p :!opout "%:p"<CR>
	map <leader>d :w<CR>

## What you MUST do

### No. 1

Stop using default keybinds to save a file, don't bother with 

To default save a file one has to...

- hold shift
- press ':'
- enter 'w'

if you are not already in escape mode one has to 

- press 'esc'

that is too many keypresses,

even 'ZZ' is no good  

# Useful

	- uncapitalize and capitalize words/lines

Vim includes a man page viewer, :Man , in its runtime files. Even better, you can just place your cursor on a word in the buffer and press <Leader>K ( \K ) to see the man page for that word.24 May 2013
