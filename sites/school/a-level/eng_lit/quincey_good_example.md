In this extract Tess chases after Angel, her husband, and reveals that she has murdered Alec - a man who has manipulated and abused Tess, and broken up hers and Alex's marriage.
Consequently, the crime elements in this extract include those of murder and violence, confession, guilt, and also moral ambiguity with regards to who the real victim of the text is.
 This essay will look at each in turn in order to understand Hardy's impliied attitude to the justice system of his period, in particular that concerning the treatment of women.

Upon first reading, one of the most obviously significant crime elements in this extract is that of murder. 
Tess's confession to Angel that 'I have killed [Alex]', identifies her unequivocally as the main criminal of the extract - a fact that is reiterated shortly afterwards when, in response to Angel's quesstion, 'how do you mean-you have killed him?' she replies simply, 'I mean that I have'.
Tess' frank and unelaborated confessions here are significant because they suggest that she may still be in shock at her actions.
This is perhaps not surprising, as she states that immediately after killing Alec, she 'dressed [her]self and came away to find you,' (i.e. Angel), suggesting that she has probably committed the crime very recently indeed. 
This sense of shock presents itself most obviously through her complete inability to articulate the facts of the murder itself, particularly when she says, 'I have done it - I don't know how'.
A psychoanalytical reading might suggest that her inarticulacy may be due to the fact that the memory has been repressed, which in turn hints at the traumatic and potentially gruesome nature of the crime.
This potential repression is particularly evident in the use of the negatively inflicted verb phrase 'don't know how'.
The memory here appears to be iinaccessible (or possible ineffable) despite the fact that it has only just happened.
Ultimately, what this reveals is that while Tess is indeed a murderer, it is perhaps not something that comes naturally to her, making her somewhat of an unlikely criminal.
