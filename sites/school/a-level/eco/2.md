# Evaluate possible methods of goverrnment intervention to reduce carbon emissions caused by road transport in the UK

> Using 2021 estimates of carbon emissions, it is estimated that a petrol car journey from London to Glasgow emits approximately 3.3 times more carbon dioxide per passenger than the equivalent journey by train.

<details><summary>Other:</summary>
Methods of government intervention may include:

- indirect taxation - e.g. tax on petrol & diesel or new car sales 
- subsidies on public transport
- subsidies on the development on electric vehicles
- minimum prices e.g. on new petrol/diesel cars
- maximum prices e.g. on public transport or electric vehicless
- Emissions trading scheme on aviation but proposed extension to road transport
- Regulation e.g. ban on sale of petrol & diesel vehicles, vehicle emission checks, ban cars in certain areas, new builds to have charging points
- Road pricing scheme, low emission zones
- Improved public transport infrastructure
- education & information schemes, tfl funded turn your idle engine of campaign
- further deregulation of public transport/creation of greaater competition in markets
- regulation by CMA of train operators to improve reliability of services/reduce prices
- increase road tax/road tax incentives for low carbon emissions vehicles
- promotion of alternative forms of transport e.g. electric bikes, cycle lanes, car sharing, bus only lanes
- incentives for working from home e.g. tax breaks
- behavioural arguments

Evaluation:

- Criticisms of the likely effectiveness of policies
- Government failure
- Inelastic PED arguments
- Weak substitute/XED arguments
- Asymmetric information
- Regulatory capture
- Time lags
- Prioritisation arguments
- Short run vs long run arguments
- Combination of policies required
- Cost and opportunity costs arguments
- Measurement issues
- Administration & enforcement issues
- Arguments surrounding the manufacturing of electric vehicles/charging points
- Behavioural arguments

## Introduction

## Paragraph 1

Indirect taxation can be doubly succesful, if taxes are earmarked for , successful taxk revenue 

if demand is elastic, conusmers are responsive thus firms are unable to pass tax onto consumers without them extitngi the mraket, thus firms will therefore have to absorb a greater proportion of the tax.

If consumers are unresponsive to price changes, then firms can pass a larger amount of tax onto consumers,,which can potentially be seen as regressive

## Conclusion
