## Assess how the age-sex composition of a population changes at different stages of the demographic transition.  (9 marks)

Different population structures of age-sex compositions at different stages of the Demographic Transition (DTM) can be shown effectively through the diagrams known as population pyramids. For stage 1 of the DTM there are high and fluctuating birth and death rates. This gives us a wide base on the population pyramid indicating a youthful population, for example as in Afghanistan. Also, the sharply indenting sides show the high death rate and low life expectancy as there is poor healthcare and technological advances in fighting diseases are non-existent, resulting in few older people. a.

In stage 2 of the DTM death rates fall whilst birth rate stays the same. The pyramid shows that there is now a slightly larger elderly population than before because people now live longer – longer life expectancy as health care improves but mostly because there is better quality nutrition and better water sanitation systems. Several of the countries of sub-Saharan Africa are thought to fit this pattern, such as Mali and Niger b.

As a country progresses to stage 3 of the DTM the upper part of the pyramid begins to properly fill out – to widen. There are now much more equal proportions (but not yet equal) between younger and older elements of the population. A larger proportion of middle aged people between 25 and 45 become apparent as well as more elderly. Countries currently at this stage are Brazil, India and Mexico. This ‘window’ of low economic dependency within the population has been called a ‘demographic dividend’ but the countries need to have the right level of governance to exploit it c.

In stage 4 we see a very balanced pyramid with largely vertical sides because both death rates and birth rates are very low and almost equal. Life expectancy is also higher than before so there are more older people. The UK was in this category until recently when an increase in birth rates caused by migration has produced a small spike in the base of the pyramid.

Lastly, stage 5 is believed to be where some countries, such as Germany, Italy and Japan are entering. This is because birth rates could further drop and we would end up with an elderly or ageing population where the majority are over 60. This is the only place where there may be a sex/gender variation, as women tend to live longer than men, so there are more elderly women in this stage d.

Commentary

This answer examines each of the DTM stages in turn and in each case the analysis is detailed and sophisticated. The first paragraph describes the shape of the pyramid with explanation of the processes behind it, together with an example a. This strategy is continued in the next two paragraphs with the third paragraph being particularly sophisticated with a reference to the demographic dividend and governance (b and c). The final two paragraphs complete the task with Stages 4 and 5 of the DTM, with a neat little reference to gender differences at the end d. Overall this a very thorough answer but lacks a summative sentence explicitly addressing the ‘assessment’ element of the question, even though evaluation has been provided implicitly throughout. For this reason, it cannot be awarded full marks.

Synoptic questions
At least one of the 9-mark questions across the examination will connect the study of geography across this specification - synopticity. There is no pattern as to where such questions fall – they may be on either Paper 1 or Paper 2, or both.

In simple terms these questions are forcing you to make connections/links across two totally different areas of content. They may have been taught to you by different teachers; they will certainly be topics you were taught at different times of your course.

I use the diagram in Figure 1 to explain the logic behind these questions. [I say ‘logic’ – but that is a generous statement. I don’t like these questions as they are too targeted, and, in my view, are NOT genuinely synoptic. But, we are where are. AQA do not like me sharing this diagram.]

As stated before, this questions can only arise in the options. Hence links have got to be backwards from the optional topics, on the right, to the Core elements on the left (the red and blue arrows). So, expect synoptic links connecting Hazards with Changing places, or Governance, or the Carbon cycle; Urban or Population or Resource geography with Global systems or landscapes, for example.

Synoptic questions may also be linked by the key concepts of Geography: globalisation, place, mitigation, feedback etc. (as shown in Table 1). I haven’t seen many examples of this in the 9-mark questions, but I have seen references to the key concepts in the 20-mark essays, which can also be synoptic. Hence there could be 20 mark questions that have synoptic links between the Core elements - see the blue arrows on the left of the diagram. [Reminder: 9-mark questions do NOT appear in the Core sections.]

## Data stimulus questions

> [source](https://dredfern.substack.com/p/the-9-mark-questions-in-aqa-a-level)

These questions assess the assessment objectives AO1 and AO2 in the proportion of 4/5 marks (Optional topics). You should demonstrate that you know the factors that underpin the context of the data provided (AO1), but also apply this knowledge to the question given (AO2). It is important that you refer to the data provided, but then use it as a stimulus to answer the question. In other words, use the data provided as a ‘springboard’.

Note (for AQA only) the questions usually use the phrase ‘...and your own knowledge’. There is also usually an element of overall assessment or evaluation in the question (involving the use of the command words ‘assess’ or ‘evaluate’). This is the AO2 part of the question, and it must be addressed. It is best addressed by either having a series of mini-conclusions at the end of each paragraph, and/or a statement of summative conclusion at the end of the answer.

You have about 10/12 minutes to answer these questions. Word length should be 250-350 words.

Here are two examples…

Example 1.

Figure 1 shows information about air pollution in Beijing, China. Using Figure 1, and your own knowledge, evaluate how air pollution in cities affects the people who live in them. (9 marks)

Figure 1. Air pollution in Beijing, China: daily average air quality index (AQI) at US Embassy, based on PM 2.5 concentration readings.


Student answer (Note comment keys at the end of each paragraph)

Poor air quality is a direct consequence of atmospheric pollution in urban areas. The amount of air pollution depends on the rate at which pollutants are produced and the rate at which they are dispersed (diluted) as they move away from their source. The five key atmospheric pollutants which are likely to have an impact on health are: ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulphur dioxide (SO2) and particulate matter. A significant local source of air pollution is traffic emissions. Photochemical smog is another problem – it causes health problems (headaches, eye irritation, coughs, and chest pains). a

Cities in the developing world are suffering from severe levels of atmospheric pollution, such as China. The Chinese capital, Beijing, has for many years suffered from serious air pollution as shown in Figure 1 with almost half of the daily averages of the Air Quality Index (AQA) being ‘unhealthy’ according to the criteria of the American Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) based on concentrations of PM2.5 particles. Such particles are small enough to be inhaled and can damage lungs. A further 18% daily averages are classed as very unhealthy and hazardous, making a total of 67%, two thirds of all the days. b

The main sources of pollutants include exhaust emission from Beijing's five million motor vehicles, coal burning in neighbouring regions, dust storms from the north and local construction dust. From a case study of Beijing I did, a severe smog engulfed the city for several weeks in January 2013 raising public awareness to unprecedented levels and prompting the government to roll out emergency measures. The smog was so bad that air quality readings from the American Embassy said simply: ‘Beyond Index’. A reading above 100 is considered ‘unhealthy for sensitive groups’ and over 400 is rated ‘hazardous’ for all. At one point a reading of 886 was recorded. Such a reading is hugely dangerous for everybody. c

So, it is fair to say that air pollution in cities does severely affect the people who live in them. d

Commentary

The first paragraph illustrates good knowledge and understanding (AO1) of the topic, giving detail of the polluting gases responsible and the causes of them a. The second paragraph makes use of the data to reinforce the point made earlier and in doing so processes the data (albeit in a simple way) rather than re-writing it b. The third paragraph introduces some case study information which conveniently matches the data – if you have studied a particular case study which features in the data, then you should use it c. Throughout the answer the student makes the necessary link to impact on people, thereby accessing the AO2 element of the task. The final sentence gives a brief statement of evaluation that summarises what has been written before. d

Example 2.

Figure 2 gives an account of plastic pollution in the world’s oceans. Using Figure 2, and your own knowledge, evaluate how the issue of plastic pollution illustrates the Population, Resources and Pollution model. (9 marks)

Figure 2. Can we tackle the ocean plastics problem?

Most of the plastic debris floating in the oceans is brought there by ten of the world’s largest rivers, including the Mekong, Yangtze, Indus and Brahmaputra in Asia, and the Nile and Niger in Africa. These river basins include some of the world’s most populous areas. The Yangtze River (1,808,500 km2) alone supplies about 1.5 million tonnes of plastic debris to the Yellow Sea each year.

Ocean currents transport these riverine inputs great distances and have produced five gigantic zones of floating plastic in the sub-tropical gyres. Who should take responsibility for cleaning up these parts of the global commons? Or should we focus efforts on tackling the problem at source?

A recent initiative based on technology supported by the Dutch government aims to clean up 50% of the large plastic debris floating in the ‘Great Pacific garbage patch’ that lies in the sub-tropical ocean gyre between California and Hawaii. This is the largest concentration of ocean plastic in the world.

In September 2018, The Ocean Cleanup campaign was launched off the coast of California. A giant floating tube, 600 metres long with a 3-metre screen suspended below, will drift with the ocean currents in a horseshoe shape and gather large plastic debris lying in its path at or near the ocean surface. A support vessel will retrieve the collected plastic for recycling in the Netherlands. The aim is to collect as much of the large floating plastic debris as possible before it breaks down into microplastic particles. The apparatus has been designed to avoid trapping marine mammals and fish.

Student answer (again with comment keys at the end of each paragraph)

The Population, Resources and Pollution model (PRP) states that people acquire resources from the environment to enhance economic development, but such use can result in pollution which damages the same environment the resources have been extracted from. Various feedback loops occur within the three main components which either enhance the relationships or seek to reduce them. a

The ocean plastic issue illustrates that people take resources from the environment to produce the plastic, but people then dispose of that plastic and therefore pollute the environment. A difference from the model is that the resources come from the ground to produce the plastic, in the form of oil, but the pollution is occurring in rivers and the oceans. b

A positive feedback loop is that as more plastic is produced to meet the needs of an increasing population, then as living standards increase, more people will demand greater use of resources, which will produce more plastic and even more pollution. Somehow this cycle must be broken if we want to preserve the oceans. c

A negative feedback loop is illustrated in Figure 2. Here an initiative to collect the plastic in the Pacific Ocean will hopefully reduce the amount of plastic floating in the ocean, so that it can be recycled (in the Netherlands), and thereby reduce the number of resources being taken from the ground by the rising population. d

The PRP illustrates the complex relationship between the three components. Plastic is a resource that is needed by a population, but one which causes pollution if not disposed of properly. e

Commentary.

The introductory paragraph illustrates good knowledge and understanding of the PRP model (AO1) a. In each of the subsequent paragraphs the student seeks to make a connection between the PRP and the issue of ocean plastic pollution. The second paragraph makes a simple point, but nevertheless a valid one b. The next two paragraphs are more sophisticated by addressing feedback loops (c and d). The second of the two makes use of the information provided in Figure 2 which is a key requirement of the question. So, throughout the answer the student makes the necessary link to the PRP, thereby accessing the AO2 element of the task. The final paragraph summarises what has gone before, but nevertheless such as statement is important AND necessary. e

Part 2, looking at the extended prose questions, will follow in a few days
