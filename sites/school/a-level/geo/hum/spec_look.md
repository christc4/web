# Global systems and global governance

Increased interdependenc and transformed relationships between peoples, states and environments, have prompted more or less successful attempts at a global llevel to manage and govern more aspects of hguman affairs.

## Globalisation

Dimensions of globalisation: flows of capital, labour, products, services and information: global marketing; patterns of production, distribution and consumption.

Factors in globalisation: development of technologies, systems and relationships, financial, transport, security communications, management and information systems and trade agreements.

## Global systems

Form and nature of economic, political, social and environmental interdependenc in the contemporary world.

Issues associated with interdependence including how:

- unequal flows of people, money, ideas and technology within global systems can sometimes act to promote stability, growth and development but can also cause inequalities, confliicts and injustices for people and places


- unequal power relations enable statse to drive global systems to their own advantage and to directly influence geopolitical events, while others are only able to respond or resist in a more constrained way

- Ha-Joon Chang
	- developed countries are attempting to 'kick away the ladder' with which they have climbed to the top, thereby preventing developing countries from adopting policies and institutions that they themselves have used
	-  great pressure on developing countries from the developed world to adopt certain 'good policies' and 'good institutions', seen today as necessary for economic development
	- good polices include: 'stable macroeconomic policies, liberal trade and investment regime, privatization and deregulation' and good institutions including democratic government, protection of property right (including intellectual property), independent central bank and transparent corporate governance institutions and financial establishments
	- Policies embraced by world bank, international monetary fund, hence the term Washington consensus
	- Paradaox that many of today's higgh income countries did not pursue such policies when they climbed economic ladder of success

## International trade and access to markets

Trading relationships and patterns between large, highly developed economies such as the United States, the EU, emerging major economies ssuch as China, India smaller less developed economies such as those in sub-Saharan Africa, southern Asia and Latin America.

Differential access to markets associtaed with levels of economic development and trading agreements and its impacts on economic and socieetal well-being.

Nature and role of transnational corporations, including their spatial organisation, production, linkages, trading and marketing patterns, with detail reference to a specified TNC and  its impacts on those countries in which it operates.

World trade in at least one food commodity or one manufactured product.

Analysis and assessment of the geographical consequences of global systems to specifically consider how international trade and variable access to markets underly and impacts on students' and other people's lives across the globe.

Globalisation critique
The impacts of globalisation to consider the benefits of growth, development, integration, stability against the costs in terms of inequalities, injustice, conflict and environmental impact.

Quantitative and qualitative skills
Students must engage with quantitative and qualitative approaches across the theme as a whole.

Changing places
This section of our specification focuses on people's engagement with places, their experience of them and the qualities they ascribe to them, all of which are of fundamental importance in their lives. Students acknowledge this importance and engage with how places are known and experienced, how their character is appreciated, the factors and processes which impact upon places and how they change and develop over time. Through developing this knowledge, students will gain understanding of the way in which their own lives and those of others are affected by continuity and change in the nature of places which are of fundamental importance in their lives.

Study of the content must be embedded in two contrasting places, one to be local. The local place may be a locality, neighbourhood or small community either urban or rural. A contrasting place is likely to be distant – it could be in the same country or a different country but it must show significant contrast in terms of economic development and/or population density and/or cultural background and/or systems of political and economic organisation.

The place studies complement the requirement to embed the study of content in two contrasting places. Study of this section offers particular opportunities to exercise and develop qualitative (and quantitative) investigative techniques and practice-related observation, measurement and various mapping skills, together with data manipulation and statistical skills including those associated with and arising from fieldwork.

The nature and importance of places
The concept of place and the importance of place in human life and experience.

Insider and outsider perspectives on place.

Categories of place:

near places and far places
experienced places and media places.
Factors contributing to the character of places:

Endogenous: location, topography, physical geography, land use, built environment and infrastructure, demographic and economic characteristics.
Exogenous: relationships with other places.
Changing places – relationships, connections, meaning and representation
In relation to the local place within which students live or study and then at least one further contrasting place and encompassing local, regional, national, international and global scales:

the ways in which the following factors: relationships and connections, meaning and representation, affect continuity and change in the nature of places and our understanding of place
and

the ways in which students’ own lives and those of others are affected by continuity and change in the nature of places and our understanding of place.
Relationships and connections
The impact of relationships and connections on people and place with a particular focus on:

either

changing demographic and cultural characteristics

or

economic change and social inequalities.

How the demographic, socio-economic and cultural characteristics of places are shaped by shifting flows of people, resources, money and investment, and ideas at all scales from local to global.
The characteristics and impacts of external forces operating at different scales from local to global, including either government policies or the decisions of transnational corporations or the impacts of international or global institutions.
How past and present connections, within and beyond localities, shape places and embed them in the regional, national, international and global scales.
Meaning and representation
The importance of the meanings and representations attached to places by people with a particular focus on people's lived experience of place in the past and at present.

How humans perceive, engage with and form attachments to places and how they present and represent the world to others, including the way in which everyday place meanings are bound up with different identities, perspectives and experiences.
How external agencies, including government, corporate bodies and community or local groups make attempts to influence or create specific place-meanings and thereby shape the actions and behaviours of individuals, groups, businesses and institutions.
How places may be represented in a variety of different forms such as advertising copy, tourist agency material, local art exhibitions in diverse media (eg film, photography, art, story, song etc) that often give contrasting images to that presented formally or statistically such as cartography and census data.
How both past and present processes of development can be seen to influence the social and economic characteristics of places and so be implicit in present meanings.
Quantitative and qualitative skills
Students must engage with a range of quantitative and qualitative approaches across the theme as a whole. Quantitative data, including the use of geospatial data, must be used to investigate and present place characteristics, particular weight must be given to qualitative approaches involved in representing place, and to analysing critically the impacts of different media on place meanings and perceptions. The use of different types of data should allow the development of critical perspectives on the data categories and approaches.

Place studies
Local place study exploring the developing character of a place local to the home or study centre.

Contrasting place study exploring the developing character of a contrasting and distant place.

Place studies must apply the knowledge acquired through engagement with prescribed specification content and thereby further enhance understanding of the way students' own lives and those of others are affected by continuity and change in the nature of places. Sources must include qualitative and quantitative data to represent places in the past and present.

Both place studies must focus equally on:

people's lived experience of the place in the past and at present
and either

changing demographic and cultural characteristics
or

economic change and social inequalities.
Suitable data sources could include:

statistics, such as census data
maps
geo-located data
geospatial data, including geographic information systems (GIS) applications
photographs
text, from varied media
audio-visual media
artistic representations
oral sources, such as interviews, reminiscences, songs etc.

Population and the environment
This optional section of our specification has been designed to explore the relationships between key aspects of physical geography and population numbers, population health and well-being, levels of economic development and the role and impact of the natural environment. Engaging with these themes at different scales fosters opportunities for students to contemplate the reciprocating relationships between the physical environment and human populations and the relationships between people in their local, national and international communities.

Study of this section offers the opportunity to exercise and develop observation skills, measurement and geospatial mapping skills, together with data manipulation and statistical skills, including those associated with and arising from fieldwork.
