• Analyse the roles of international government organisations and NGOs in the governance of Antarctica and assess
their effectiveness.
Antarctica is a global common that consists of an expanse of 14 million km2
 and despite the inhospitable conditions (e.g.
average temperatures of -49’C), technological improvements have made it possible for this great wilderness to be
economically developed. As well as this, human activity has led to global environmental issues, which are having an impact
upon this fragile landscape. Due to these concerns, the role of international organisations and NGO’s have become
imperative; although their effectiveness has come under question.
Major organisations that are involved with setting up systems of global governance in regard to Antarctica include the
Antarctic Treaty System (ATS) in association with the UNEP who are responsible to reporting activity in Antarctica to the
UN. The Antarctic Treaty was set up in 1959 as an agreement (international law) on how to sustainably manage
Antarctica’s ecosystem. It has now been signed by 53 countries who agree that Antarctica should only be used for peaceful
purposes (e.g. no weapons or army bases), also it should only be used for cooperative scientific research and must remain
a global common. This form of global governance has also proved effective at dealing with issues of ownership. Different
parts of Antarctica are claimed by seven different nations and many of these claims created disputes as these different
claims overlapped (e.g. United Kingdome and Argentina.) The Antarctic treaty successfully dealt with this issue by putting
this claims aside and setting the area up as a global common of shared ownership. Therefore, to this day it can be argued
that it has managed to protect this area from economic development and encourage greater international cooperation.
Criticism of the Antarctic Treaty has been that it relies on international laws and these laws are only enforceable if nations
agree to sign up and agree to them. The Antarctic Treaty has also been criticized in the past, over its lack of transparency
concerning conferences. During the 1980’s The Convention on the Regulation of Antarctic Mineral Resource Activities
(CRAMRA) was being discussed, however after eighteen years of discussion (which much was behind closed doors) France
& Australia refused to sign and it was replaced by the Madrid Protocol in 1998. This effectively banned all mining except for
research purposes. Several NGO’s including the ASOC (Adaption, Antarctic and Southern Ocean Coalition) felt that this lack
of transparency could have led to individual nations placing economic advantages of mining before environmental
protection and without public awareness of the planning stage global norms would have been less effective at applying
influence.
Another international governmental organisation that has been successful in creating global governance concerning
Antarctica is the International Whaling Commission (IWC). In 1994, it set up the whale sanctuary in the Southern Ocean to
protect the whales. However due to a lack of funding it has not had the ability to effectively monitor the number of whales
in the sanctuary. The IWC also set up the Whaling Moratorium in 1982 and although this helped to ban commercial
whaling, it only proved effective with countries that agreed to sign up to this international law. The lack of monitoring also
meant that Japan has continued to whale and in 2016 they killed 333 minke whales for so-called ‘research’ purposes.
It can be clearly seen that international governmental organisations have proved effective at encouraging global
cooperation about global commons such as Antarctica, however; laws are only effective when agreed to by nations across
the globe, as well as when there is clear monitoring and enforcement to ensure nations abide to their commitments.
Therefore, this ‘top down’ approach is not always effective on its own.
NGO’s apply a different technique and prove effective at applying ‘bottom up’ techniques, which help to strengthen the
weaknesses in the global governance in Antarctica. For example, Greenpeace has persistently challenged Japanese whaling
ships in the Southern Ocean by intercepting their whaling ‘research’ activities and reporting their activities to the IWC as
well as the World’s media. Although they have not been successful at bringing legal prosecutions to the Japanese Whaling
ships, they have made use of ‘global norms’ to lobby the Japanese government and apply economic pressure by
encouraging followers to boycott Japanese products.
Another NGO that helps with the monitoring of Antarctica is the Antarctic and Southern Ocean Coalition (ASOC), which was
formed in 1978. As with Greenpeace, they do not have ability to set laws of governance however, they have successfully
campaigned for greater transparency with legal proceeding concerning Antarctica. They have also been effective in helping
to ensure different stakeholders are placing environmental systems before economic systems. In the past internal
governmental organisations have proven to be biased and will set up laws that promote the desires of overseeing
countries (normally western HIC’s), however the ASOC have proven effective at being a non-biased external agency that
can ensure that governments are not acting in their own interests.
Overall it can be argued that international governmental organisations have proven effective at setting up global
governance with the Antarctic global common, however without the lobbying of NGO’s these institutions would prove to
be less effective. Both ‘top down’ and ‘bottom up’ techniques complement each other in guaranteeing the environmental
security of Antarctica; however, with increase demand for resources with a growing global population, these systems will
be further challenged in the future. In conclusion, it can be seen that global institutions have been effective at dealing with
the challenges of fishing, whaling, mining and tourism in Antarctica however; they have proven to be ineffective at dealing
with the threat of climate change that continues to challenge the resilience Antarctica’s flora and fauna. This was clearly 
exemplified in 2016 when thousands of emperor penguin chicks were wiped out by the collapse of the sections of the
Brunt ice shelf.
Task: This essay is too long. However, use this as a source of ideas or create your own plan.
1) Make a list of the different organisations discusses.
2) For each organisation, outline its advantages and disadvantages.
