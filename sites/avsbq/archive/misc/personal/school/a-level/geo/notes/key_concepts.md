Causality - Connectionos between cause (why) and consequence as part of a process, in many cases processes have many causal factors

Systems - Many interacting component parts, producing a complex

Feedback - Positive feedback causing further change and instability to a system, or negative feedback returning a system to equilibrium

Inequality - At all scales, differences in opportunity, access to resources or outcomes (e.g. health) between different groups

Globalisation -  The set of processes leading to greater integration economically, culturally and demographically

Interdependence - Mutal reliance betweeen groups; it is strongly linked to globalisation

Mitigation & Adaptation - Alternative approaches to management: prevention (mitigation) versus reducing vulnerability (adaptation)

Sustainability - Passing the planet and its natural systsems and resources onto the next generation in as good a state as we inherited it

Risk - The potential or probability of harm/losing something of value

Resillience - The ability to cope with change e.g. resilience to global warming or a natural hazard such as an earthquake, or a human change such as an economic recession

Threshold - A tipping point in a system; a critical level beyond which change is inevitable/irreversible
