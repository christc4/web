## Ackroyd

"I was at Poirot's elbow the whole time. I saw what he sam... [My] narative might have been that of Poirot himself. I played Watson to his Sherlock"

Sheppard acts as an amanuensis	, but given no access to the conclusions poirot reaches

"Though poirot showed me all his discoveries he hald back the vital and yet logical impressions he formed. As i came to know later, this secrecy was charactiseristic if him. He wolud throuw out hints and suggestions but beyond that he wtould not go

Sheppard himself never reveals why he blackmails mrs ferrars, we rely here only on poiots inetrpretation

.A


Christie (through sheppard)) draws our attention to gaps in the story, 
 i am rather pleased wyth myself as a wwrite


poirot picks up on the chair out of place " a scrap of stiff whitwe cambric" that rhe recognises due to its inroned state as from a maids apron

the society forces crime on them

you cant tell who are ladies and who arent nowadays, traditionally to be a lady the novel implies to be dependent on patriachy for one's living and economic support

The novel ultimately represents the social order as flawed,  almost every member of society playing a part, performing a misleading .
mrs ferrars up until her suicids high in village social heirachy she ows one if its two most important  but is unsuspected a murderess and blackmail victim

despite coming across as the archtypical village doctor, sheppard harms its social body as blackmailer, murderer

ackroyds housekeeper "a redoubtable lady called MissRussel" keeps the existence of her illegitimate cocaine addicted son 

poirot links the greed of a criminal to "when the chance of money opens at his feet" like a "gold mine"

Poirit allows sheppard to commit suicide the effect of which is that sheppard can maintain his goord reputaition no shoadow will be cast on the normative patterns and assumptions of the community life


poicoig depentds on the "psychology of a crime"A rather than any active physical pursuit of perpetrator

"weak as water"
