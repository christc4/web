Explore the significance of crime in this extract

In Snowdrops, Miller shapes meaning through the various elements of crime: death,
victimhood, and crime-scene.
One perspective can suggest, the manner in which the crime scene is being processed by the
Moscow police implies a lack of care and emotion. Another reading is that Miller's account of
the death exemplifies the brutality and sickening aspect of crime. A final interpretation is that
the significance of victimization conveys the sense that victims are simply forgotten about in
Moscow. This essay will discuss the significance of each theme and conclude whether one is
most significant.
 It can be argued that the Moscow police express a lack of emotional attachment and care.
The extract begins by describing police officers; "talking on phones", "smoking",
"looking/looking away". The listing of sensory verbs could suggest that the officers are not very
invested in the actual crime scene itself, suggesting the officers are not very empathetic or
passionless about their work as they show more interest towards attending their own needs.
Moreover, Miller notes the officer’s saying, “the cold had kept it fresh”, the adjective fresh
dehumanises the corpse as if it was meat, perhaps suggesting the offcier finds it comical or
accentuates the notion he cannot empathise with the body. Moreover, an officer says “he had
not done a good job” this suggests that Moscow officers are used to encountering crimes worse
than this and furthers the notion that they have a comical attitude towards a crime scene. Yet
this may also imply a sense of routineness in their job as their repeated exposure to crime
desensitizes them to an extent, leaving them inapt at expressing emotion towards crime.
Moreover, this reading may imply that the scale of crime in Moscow is so large that most of the
Moscow police force are similarly unempathetic towards crime scene handling.
However, a more plausible interpretation is that Miller’s description of the death itself summarises the
brutality. “I smelled it before I saw it” opens the extract, immediately distinguishing the olfactory verb
“smell” before the sensory verb “saw”. This implies that the “smell” overwhelms Miller, we later learn
the smell’s source is a corpse. This can be read to suggest that a sickening aspect of crime is how long a
body is left undiscovered, as it develops an “acidic rubbish-[like] smell” and “greenish flesh”. Moreover
this may also suggest that time delays in finding the body point towards criminals being able to escape
punishment in Moscow for equally long durations of time. Furthermore, Miller’s still-like description of
the foot “stepping very slowly” adds a sense of sickening, although decomposing, the man’s foot is
framed to suggest he looks alive which encapsulates the sickening aspect as the overall description is
zombie-like. This theory is reinforced by Miller as the narrator says, “I can still see the foot now” which
suggests that this lingers in his mind and troubles him due to the shortness of the sentence. The death
itself perfectly captures the brutality as the man has effectively been bludgeoned to death with a 
“hammer/brick” and done “not good”. This implies he endured significant physical suffering capturing
how brutal and heartless criminals in Moscow can be.
On the other hand, victimhood can be seen as Miller demonstrating how easily people in Moscow forget
crime. “Murder victims hidden in the drifts... which you somehow manage not to see” perfectly captures
this notion as “drifts” suggests that the body is not covered properly yet “hidden” suggests otherwise.
This sense of oxymoronic storytelling is carried out by “manage not to see” which implies people in
Moscow purposefully ignore crime. Moreover, “somehow” conveys a sense of convenience to the
passerby, perhaps it is risky for civillians to involve themselves and as a result turn the blind eye.
Moreover the extract’s final line, “sometimes for ever” conveys the idea that some crimes in Moscow
will simply go undiscovered, justice will not be carried out and no victim/murderer will be identified.
In conclusion, although victimhood and the police’s handling of the crime scene may suggest a fault in
the police system and that Moscow society attitudes towards victims are not fair, it is undoubtable that
death is the most significant element of crime as it captures the brutality of the victim’s death. The
lingering consequences of the murder are symbols of the merciless nature of Moscow’s criminals, and
how they have disfigured the victim beyond recognisability
