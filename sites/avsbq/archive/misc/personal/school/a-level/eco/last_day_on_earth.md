Nominal GDP, the output method the final value of all goods and services,

The income method, add up all the factor incomes, wages salaries, rent profit plus interest

expenditure method, sum of ad concepts


real gdp = nominal gdp / base number times 100

the GNI, ggdp plus net factor income domestic factors abrooad minus foreign factor domestically

green gdp equals gdp minus environmentals cost

Circular flow, comparee injections and leakages

I + G + X = savings, taxation + import 
 
multiplier 

1/mpw, mpw = mps + mpt + mps 

Change in national income, injection times the multiplier

Accelerator effect, increase in the rate of growth of gdp

budget deficit, when gov spending greater than tax revenue in a FISCAL YEAR

VICE VERSA for surplus

unemployment rate, nummber of unemployed divide the labour force

Index nuwber number you want to convert divide by raw number in a base year multiply by a hundred

Weighted CPI = convert prices to index using equation above , multiply index pries by the weights, add up weighted prices then divide by total number of weights

Real interest rate , nominal interest rate minus inflation rate

Extensible evaluations:

	   Productivity decreases if capital and labour combine now produce less with the same level of factor inputs.
	   
	   Current governments are incentivised to choose popular short-termist policies over unpopular effective long term policies,  newly voted governments could reverse changes
	   Neither policy by their own merits are effective at reducing inflation,

	   Given the current assymetric information, it's wiser to employ a combination of polices, to act as a fallback

	   Since economics is a social science, no plan can be fully watertight, there are many unintended consequences that can crop up at any stage of planning and it is impossible to fully map out or show diagramatically how an economy will respondo,



	   
Subsidising firms reduces costs of production and increases worker productivity. Specialisation positively correlates with labour productivity, being the output per worker. Were this to increase, cost per unit would in turn decrease, which enables international exporters to lower their price, ceteris paribus foreign UK exports will become more attractive to foreign buyers.

If currency depreciates, ceteris paribus, buyers are happier because their units of foreign currency can buy more units of UK goods, than previous.

Arguments against subsidies, we must consider that firms are ultimately disincentivised to invest in "worker training", post-subsidy because of threats like "worker poaching" from rival firms.

Alternatively, interventionist supply-side policies can increase funding of education/infrastructure. Were funds allocated towards constructing motorways, the geographical mobility of workers may improve. Education leads to a more qualified workforce, which in turn can see a higher proportion of the population working in sectors that contribute to technological innovations.

However, effects may only be felt in the long-run

Cost push inflation may erode/dampen the benefits of a currency depreciation.

# Contractionary fiscal policy notes


> Cuts in gov. expenditure disproportionately affect lower income brackets, reliant on social transfers, which increases inequality, contrary to the UK macroeconomic objectives

Government lowers AD through decreases in goovernment spending, to lower the price level. Expenditure cuts to "social transfer payments" such as "universal credit" reduces claimants disposable income, thus diminishing their marginal propensity to consume.

Increasing taxes like "corporate tax" disincentivises firms from investing, as rising external costs lower disposable capital.

Were both investment and consumption to fall a significant fall in AD can be predicted, combined both combonents compose 70 percent of AD, in turn greatly lowering price levels.

As reflected on the Diagram...

If taxes increase, firms make workers redundant, so as to save on costs, increasing unemployment,,


Lower investment poured into Research & Development inhibits technological advancement and innovation within UK industries, lowering international competitiveness. Therefore, despite bringing inflation closer to the BoFe target of plus/minus two percent, CFP

However, even if corporate tax increases while yes some firms may be incentivised to move core operations to countries with lower taxes, there is a time lag to moving headquarters and some large firms may just choose to absorb this increase in taxes

Were firms to receive government subsidisation, they may pass savings onto consumers, in turn seeing the price level fall to...

Contractionary fiscal policy may exacerbate existing issues such as NHS/Council waiting times,

# Inequality

Expansionary fiscal policy, whereby governments increase expenditure could reduce inequality.

Allocating more funds to social transfer schemes increases claimants disposable incomes, they tend to be on the lowest income bracket, and most importantly thiss lets them fund various aspects of their lives such as childcare, housing and basic necessities.

Increased funding, for welfare schemes, can relive strain on services, it can be argued increases in expenditure directly reduce inequality as they proportionately affect, however,

> Friedrich Hayek - "It is difficult for an economy to mobilise if information is dispersed"  there is imperfect information held  by government bodiess many unknowns and assumptions, including but not limited to which regions/welface schemes need funding the most and how much

If the pound has fallen then there is import led cost push inflation, whereas export led growth leads to improveement in the UK's trade position

Debt repayments may be a factor for stagnant economic growth, hovever is that debt was to finance LRAS it may not be problematic, as the opportunity cost of not borrowing would be worse of

Between 2012 and 2017, the UK saw a fall in unemployment, but real wage growth remained weak, in the twoo thousands we had a fall in unemployment without inflationary pressure, part of this was due to the fact falling unemployment reflected a fall in the natural rate of unemployment

If house prices fall by 10-20% this translates to homeowner value asset decreasing, whereupon they "feel' relatively less wealthy, despite no change in real income, this often causes theyre marginal propensity to save to be greater than their marginal propensity to consume. In theory, consumption being 60% percent of AD tied with the fact an equal number, are UK homeowwvers an inwards shift of AD is plausible
