# Homo Economicus

John Stuart Mill's (1836) famous essay "On the Definition of Political
Economy; and on the Method of Investigation Proper to It" described a
hypothetical subject, whose narrow and well-defined motives made him a useful
abstraction in economic analysis. At first glance it might seem that this economic man bears a striking resemblance to Ingram's and Keynes' caricatures.

According to Mill (1836, p. 321), political economy:

> ... does not treat of the whole of man's nature as modified by the social
state, nor of the whole conduct of man in society. It is concerned with him
solely as a being who desires to possess wealth, and who is capable of
judging the comparative efficacy of means for obtaining that end.

But on the same page Mill goes on to qualify this proposition strongly:

> It [political economy] makes entire abstraction of every other human
passion or motive; except those which may be regarded as perpetually
antagonizing to the desire of wealth, namely, aversion to labour, and
desire of the present enjoyment of costly indulgences. These it takes, to a
certain extent, into its calculations, because these do not merely, like other
desires, occasionally conflict with the pursuit of wealth, but accompany it
always as a drag, or impediment, and are therefore inseparably mixed up
in the consideration of it.
