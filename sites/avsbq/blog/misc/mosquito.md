When I visited Bangladesh, mosquito galore!

## How to prevent mosquito problem?

Kill at larval stage...

- drain/fill breeding site
- screening/covering water tanks
- dry out irrigation channel weekly, thus interrupting life-cycle of mosquito
- stock water sites with fish, which eat larvae, said fish can also be food source e.g. 'grass carp'
