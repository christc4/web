# Contraception

Paraphrased from Fr. Josiah Trenham

God fashioned sexuality, the pleasure is so intense in order to justify the great burden of parenting

If you looked at a farmer and he took seed and he purposely threw it into the trees instead of the fields you'd think hes insane.

The fertile field is the maternal womb and can be an eternal being
