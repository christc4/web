# Righteous Indignation

2024/09/29

Righteous anger moves you in the right direction, the most egrigious thing one can do to themselves in having been inconvienced by something, perhaps even left at their wits end, is to not cut oneself from said thing, when easily available...

This isn't taught to children... Instead we are encouraged to do breathing exercises, meditate.. block out all noise. It doesn't help that in a classroom setting you cannot really remove yourlef from the problem

Such methods simply adapt our body to stress, instead of channelling that righteous anger to deal with said issue.

Of course living in a manmade society makes this a little difficult

Consider, the idiotic uproar over Lil Nas X. If you really took upbridge you'd uproot all the provocative music. Instead they roamed free on our airwaves. You should have been feeling righteous indignation years ago, or perhaps you didn't act on it

Thus the same offense, was blocked out, like white noise, until something touches your nerve.. but btw that new anger isn't righteous indignation it's childish anger

so many windows or mac os users, could have used that anger to switch to linux, when the time was right..
