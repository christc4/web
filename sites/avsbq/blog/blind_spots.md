I have long since been fascinated with elderly englishmen and women giving an account of their childhood and such.. It never occured to me in my naive adolesence that perhaps they were viewing the past with rose-tinted spectacles

One should pay particular attention if a doddering oldie might airbrush over a segment of their lives

## Common frames of reference

Common frames of reference, whether pop-culture, literature, history, religion in a way are social interactions which instill a sense of bond between people.. The more localised and niche one can pick up on a reference the stronger the bond.

In Gulliver's Travels there exists a particular people called the [Struldbruggs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Struldbrugg), hailing from the nation of Luggnagg who are in fact immortal!

One adverse effect of such a _blessing_ was that the elderly and young could no longer communicate, their once common tongue had drifted apart enormously between generations.

Back to real life... I can relay this thought to being schooled in Shadwell, East London. The white English teachers would often give pithy remarks in Cockney speak or use Cockney to chide us. I of course, am not a Cockney but I had enough little grey cells to put 2 and 2 together. However, my Shadwell schooling ended in 2016 and as I am aware, people do die. And as the immigrant children of Shadwell grow up they will start applying for the same teaching jobs my Cockney teachers once held. So I do not expect new waves of schooled immigrant children to know a smattering of Cockney

In Roman Road, East London, there was an elderly English man manning a clothes shop once and I vividly spoke to him about 'starched collars'. I knew of their existence and prevalence because I for a time was fascinated with historical tailoring. He seemed much delighted that I understood what it meant to collect one's colours and give them to the laundromat for them to come out hard as a brick! He also was able to talk about the Teddy Boy phenomenom to which I also knew about
