Hello. 
Thank you for your email, and I'm pleased you find my posts interesting and useful.

The basis of our query sounds very American in outlook. I don't agree with the premise; I think if you are happy and content in your 'place', urban or rural, then that is what most people want. The concept of 'love' in such circumstances seems a bit over the top.... as I say, American!

I wish you success in your exams. 

David

Dear Mr Redfern,

I'd like to firstly like to thank you - as a long time reader of your substack I've found your commentary and takes on exam techniques/responses - invaluable towards my personal revision. You truly are an unsung hero in the A-Level geography sphere. So please accept my thanks.

I've been musing over this thought I had heard from an American online, who posited the bold claim that no-one in cities "loves their home". His reasoning being, a city dweller has no tie with the land his apartment/house is built on. If the quality of his neighborhood or urban surroundings go down under - it has a relatively small bearing on his livelihood. To continue, reiterating his argument... City folk don't love their "home", they live their "place" because it's close geographically to their area of work/education. Whereas, if you live in the country side and the health of your land starts to deteriorate - so does your livelihood - your vested interest in the pastoral upkeep of the land is essential for the continuation of you and your future generations... 

I thought that was an interesting statement but didn't think much of it - that is until I visited East Ham in London for the first time. I recall reading somewhere in a Human Geography resource, cities start to decline when betting shops prop up... In the town square I counted no less than five bookmakers, with there being two paddypowers on virtually the same street. In the McDonald's early in the morning, it was full of homeless people. And right next to all of this was a spanking new fleet of new-builds. So now my view has fundementally changed. East Ham can have as many betting shops as it can squeeze in, and the homeless population can continue to rise - but  those in newly built homes as long as they can still trek to their work/school - they remain relatively unscathed.

To recall the person I originally heard this view from, "City people don't love their home. They might "love" the art-deco of their apartment, the exposed brick walls and the night life, but as their future is not staked on the quality and health of the city - they do not love their city"

I was  just curious since you have been around much longer than I have - and are sure to have seen towns, cities go belly down under and revive from the ashes - what do you make of the bold claim.

Thank you and Kind Regards,

Christ Amlai

## What do I mean

Let me put it like this.

I find it highly dubious to hear someone in a city like London, say they 'love' their city...

If your soil erodes and becomes infertile in a rural plot of land, your way of life goes belly-under.

The same cannot be said of heavily urbanised cities,

If the town centre degrades, becomes full of betting shops, homeless, drug addicts, 

As long as you are geographically close to your place of work/schooling you are fine,

As long as you live in a new-build, you are fine

## Update

On the 12th of August 2024, I read Simon Webb's marvelous book, A 1960s East End Childhood

Let me say this, with the rapid miscegenation, and disappearance of the native cockneys or working class, gentrification etc. Such tight knit communities do net exist. I know this as the very same areas Simon Webb describes growing up in, I too grew up in.
