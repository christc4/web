# Offloading parenting

*Last update: 2024/09/20*

Offloading parenting is the transferral of father/motherly duties onto others. The closest word in modern exchange is  'outsourcing'

> _where you move internal operations to a third party_

At its core, imagine it as passing the parental torch onto total strangers.

To prime our brains let's disect the commonmost scenarios.

## Scenario A

*Note to reader*: I only draw upon 'fitness' since its a popular example. Real 'fit'ness is going on hikes with your kids and finding cool rocks or bugs.. Not running aimlessly or lifting man-made weights..

A dad never begins a fitness regimen with his son. Young and impressionable, he soon becomes totally enraptured by an influencer promising them an incredible return rate for simply starting fitness - all the while introducing moral decay to your childs world view - and thus their working out stems from such influences

Go ahead and rightfully label their wellspring of motivation as a:

- grifter
- con-artist
- snake-oil salesman
- pimp (not a Positively.Inspirational.Motivational.Person)

Your points no matter how true they ring become null and void. Your standing as a man of fitness is non-existant

## Scenario B

Every child has a natural affinity to games,

That doesn't mean a parent has to do his homework on every triple A title and grind hours in a battle royale. Knowing about board gamees, dice games, card games, indie games, story games, point and click, RTS doesn't hurt you. By forgoing this bonding experience with them, transfers this to an online community or YouTuber..

## What isn't offloading?

You'd be right to point out, not everyone is a physicist, would I be offloading my parental duties by hiring a Physics tutor to teach my child? Let's touch back on the definition of outsourcing,

> to move core operations to a third party

 Keep a breadth of wise, knowledgeable friends. Friends that are good at manual work and those that are more scientifically suited, then its okay to offload the hard stuff

With friends, you can vet them, with teachers and tutors not so much. Of course everyone has skeletons in their closet. But I like to think our friends are on our side. 

## Who is most guilty of  this

When I was younger, I loved seeing rural American families pass on hunting skills to their kids, I think urbanites are most guilty of this

### Solutions

People can be lazy, unwilling, neglecent. Morally compromised. People might also not know any better. In a parent's heart of hearts I like to believe they already know what they think of the term 'offloading'
