# Xah Fly Keys

As Xah describes in [xahlee.info](http://xahlee.info/emacs/misc/xah-fly-keys.html)...

> Xah Fly Keys is more efficient than vim, or any keybinding set in history.

> xah-fly-keys.el is a modal editing mode for emacs, like vi, but the design of key/command choice is based on command frequency statistics and ease-of-key score. Most frequently used commands have most easy keys.

> If you have hand pain from using emacs, consider using Xah Fly Keys. Never need to press Ctrl+x and never need to press Meta anymore.
