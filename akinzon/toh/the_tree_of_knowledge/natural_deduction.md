Proofs can be seen as trees, where leaves are the assumptions and the root is the proven formula

Internal nodes are determined by applications of the proof rules

There are two types of proof rules:
	**Introduction rules** - These rules allow for the introduction of a logical connective (Your unary/binary operators)
	**Elimination rules** - eliminating a logical connective
