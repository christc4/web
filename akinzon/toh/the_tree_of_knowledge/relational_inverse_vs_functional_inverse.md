# Relational Inverse vs Functional Inverse

While the inverse of a relation is always a relation, not all [functions](functions) have inverses.

For example, if you defined a relation that mapped people to their birthdays, it wouldn't have an inverse function as multiple people can share the same birthday.

In this case, [Domain Restriction in Event-B|range restriction](domain_restriction_in_event-b|range_restriction) could be used to return the domain of the birthday function that is restricted to mapping to the specified range.
