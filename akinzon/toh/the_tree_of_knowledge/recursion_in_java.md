As we have learnt from [JVM Stacks](jvm_stacks), any time [methods](methods) are called, a [The Java Stack Frame|stack frame](the_java_stack_frame|stack_frame) is created. This is even the same for recursion, where we call the same method over and over, but with different parameters!

1) true because for example, a Node object could have a Node as the value of Node.next, if you were creating a linked list for example

2) tail recursion can be optimised since the recursive call is at the end, it can just use the same stack frame which would make it as efficient as iteration 

3) It could be argued that it being unsafe is due to abuse, and not due to recursion itself

4) stack overflow renders this false
