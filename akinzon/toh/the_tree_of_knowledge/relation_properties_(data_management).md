TARGET DECK

Relations ($R(A_1,...,A_k)$) have these following properties:
	- Each row in a relation is a $k$-tuple
	- Rows have no order ([Set Rules and Syntax|set property](set_rules_and_syntax|set_property))
	- Rows must all be distinct (set property)
	- The way columns/attributes are ordered aren't 100% important (but it can be)
	- How important a column/attribute is depends on what it is named (ids are super important)
