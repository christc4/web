[Arrays](arrays) are treated as [Objects](objects), and so are stored in the heap.

For arrays, what's stored is:
	- array length
	- array data (objects/[primitives](primitives))
	- pointer to array class, array class being stored in [method area](method_area)


Despite not being a fully-fledged [Objects|object](objects|object), are [Arrays](arrays) stored in [the heap](the_heap)? What exactly is stored? #flashcard 
Yes, they are. For an array, what's stored is:
Array length
Array data (objects/[primitives](primitives))
[C Pointers|Pointer](c_pointers|pointer) to the Array [Classes|class](classes|class) in the [method area](method_area)
