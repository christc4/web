Generating functions are like using the [Counting via Polynomial Coefficient|polynomial coefficient](counting_via_polynomial_coefficient|polynomial_coefficient) but on an even greater level

Given a sequence $\{1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1\}$, its generating function is:
$$ 1(x^0)+x+x^2+x^3+x^4+x^5$$

These three things are the same:

For sequence $\{0, 1, 2, 3\}$ its generating function is:
$$ x + 2x^2 + 3x^3  $$
