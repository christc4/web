Graphs $G = (V, E)$ are a [Sets|set](sets|set) of **vertices** $V$ and a set of **edges** $E$ that connect vertices.

Edges usually have a **weight** or **cost** associated with them.

Elements of $E$ are a pair $(v, w)$ where $v, w \in V$. This means that $w$ is **adjacent** to $v$.

But these elements can be an [Ordered Pairs|ordered pair](ordered_pairs|ordered_pair) which means that the graph is **directed**.
