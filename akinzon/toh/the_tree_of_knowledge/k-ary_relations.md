We know that relations are subsets of the Cartesian Product of two sets

We can extend that to formally say that a $k$-ary relation is the subset of the Cartesian Product of $k$ sets.

Relations have what is known as **arity**, which is just the value of $k$.

Binary relations (essentially [ordered pairs](ordered_pairs)) have an arity of 2.

$k$-ary relations contain $k$-tuples.

Each value in a tuple is an attribute, and is part of a column of attributes, all of the same type!
