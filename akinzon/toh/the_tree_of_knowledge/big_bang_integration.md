TARGET DECK

Big Bang Integration is a non-incremental approach where each unit of the system is tested in [Testing in Isolation|isolation](testing_in_isolation|isolation) thoroughly and then the whole system is integrated

For example, if a system had 5 units, each of those units would be tested on their own, and then brought together, like 5 students working on a coursework, each doing different parts, and bringing it together.
