For independent variables $X$ and $Y$:
$$ \mathbb{E}[XY] = \mathbb{E}[X] \mathbb{E}[Y] $$

Similarly, $\mathbb{E}[X_1X_2 · · · X_n] = \mathbb{E}[X_1]\mathbb{E}[X_2] · · · E[X_n]$ if all $X_i$ are independent.


### B-But what if $X$ and $Y$ are not independent???
In this case, only the first line of the proof counts, and the value is calculated using the joint probabilities.
$$ \sum_{x∈\mathcal{X}, y∈\mathcal{Y}}f(x,y)p(x,y) = \sum_{x∈\mathcal{X}, y∈\mathcal{Y}}xyp(x,y)$$

Where $x$ and $y$ are the specific values of $X$ and $Y$, and $p(x,y)$ is the joint probability.
