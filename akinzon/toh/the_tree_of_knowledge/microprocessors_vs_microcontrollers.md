Microprocessors        |       Microcontrollers
-------------------|-----------------------------
[The Processor](the_processor), [RAM](ram), [External Memory](external_memory), etc. All kept separate| Everything integrated onto a single chip
Amount of RAM, storage, I/O can be set at design time| There is a fixed amount of RAM and storage
Higher cost, but is more versatile and general purpose| Low cost, but is only useful within a certain storage/power constraint
High performance, high power| Low performance, low power
64-bit| 8, 16, 32-bit
Deep pipeline| Short pipeline
