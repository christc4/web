Early GPUs used fixed-function [GPU Simplified Pipeline|pipelines](gpu_simplified_pipeline|pipelines).

In the 2000s, programmable shading was added to GPUs
	- Much, much faster than [The Processor|CPUs](the_processor|cpus) for looping floating-point maths

Generic stream processing units allow the GPUs of today to be better at general computing - [GPUs as co-processors](gpus_as_co-processors)

The General Purpose GPUs of today are more flexible than the fixed-function pipelined ones of yesterday.

How has the GPU changed over time, in terms of functional advancements? #flashcard 
[The GPU](the_gpu) has moved from pipelines to programmable shading and general processing units, which both give the GPU more flexibility.
