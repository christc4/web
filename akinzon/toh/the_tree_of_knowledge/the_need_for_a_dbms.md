TARGET DECK

One of the key needs for a DBMS is **Data Independence**.

This is the idea that applications and users should not have to worry about how data is structured and stored.

Data independence can be split into two categories:
	**Logical Independence:** Users/apps not worrying about the way the data is structured **within** the database, the data they want is what they get, always
	**Physical Independence:** Users/apps not worrying about how the database is stored **on** the disk (not worrying about storage space or anything like that)
