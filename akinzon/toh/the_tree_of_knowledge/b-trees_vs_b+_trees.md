Brother(s):
TARGET DECK


| B-Tree | B+ Tree |
| ---- | ---- |
| All internal nodes contain<br>data pointers **and** keys | Only leaf nodes contain actual<br>data pointers, non-leaf nodes are simply keys |
| No sequential access | Allows for sequential access due to data being stored similar to [linked lists](linked_lists) |
| Slower searching | Faster searching |
| Slower insertion/deletion | Faster insertion/deletion |
