In the past, read/write heads have used magnetic coils with electromagnetic induction to convert electric signals into magnetic patterns which are written onto the disk. Now, magnetoresistive sensors are preferred.

The head is made of a magnetisable material; reversing the direction of current reverses the direction of magnetisation on the disk. This is how 0s and 1s are written.

There are two heads for either side of a disk platter.
