TARGET DECK

The relational image of a set $X$ under a relation $R$ is written as $R[A]$.

Apart from the $R[A]$ bit, that was a load of waffle. This cooked formal definition might clear things up...

$$ y \in R[A]\ \exists x Â· x \in A \land x \mapsto y \in R $$
What this means is there is a $y$ in the relational image $R[A]$ if there exists an $x$ in $A$ that maps to $y$ **in** the relation $R$.
