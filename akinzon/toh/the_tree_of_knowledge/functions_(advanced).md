#### Injective Functions
A function is injective (1-to-1, into) if each element in the domain is mapped to a different element in the codomain.

Therefore:
	f(x) = f(y) implies that x = y.

	^ First is surjective and second isn't because they need to map to different elements.


#### Surjective Functions
A function is surjective (onto) if each element in the codomain is mapped to (codomain = range)

Therefore:
	∀y ∈ Y ∃x ∈ X, f(x) = y
	(For all y in Y there exists an x in X such that f(x) = y, that x will map to that y)

#### Bijective Functions
A function is bijective if it is both injective and surjective.
