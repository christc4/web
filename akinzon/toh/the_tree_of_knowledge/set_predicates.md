**Predicates** ( $φ(x)$ ) are statements that are either true or false about a member x of a set/universe/world. We say that it holds for a or that a satisfies $φ$ when $φ(a)$ is true.

We can create **[Set Relations|Subsets](set_relations|subsets)** of a set that contain elements satisfying a predicate $φ$

The subset of X that satisfies the predicate $φ$ is denoted by:
	$\{ x | x ∈ X \land φ(x) \}$
	^ x such that is is a member of X and satisfies $φ$
