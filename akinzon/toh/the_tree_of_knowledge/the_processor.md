The processor is the guy who gets stuff done in the computer. In the [Instruction cycle](instruction_cycle), the processor fetches the instruction, decodes it and then executes the instruction.

Two types of CPU architecture - [Harvard Architecture|Harvard](harvard_architecture|harvard) and [von Neumann Architecture|Von Neumann](von_neumann_architecture|von_neumann)

Generally though, most CPUs today just use a modified Harvard architecture with separate instruction and data **caches** instead of of separate memories.

The processor has been improved over time - from [Multi-core CPUs](multi-core_cpus) to [Other CPU Improvements](other_cpu_improvements)

Processors main storage is [registers](registers)
