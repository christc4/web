With permutations, you are choosing a subset of numbers from a set where the order they go in matters.

Where there is no repetition allowed, it is the factorial of the length of the subset. So for a permutation of 5 numbers, the answer would be 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 since the amount of possible values for each space decreases as you go on

Permutations are an ordered arrangement of a set of **distinct** objects.

## Generalised Permutations

A generalized permutation is an ordered arrangement of a set of **non-distinct** objects.

> [!TIP]- How many permutations can be formed from the letters HAPPY?
> First, use subscripts to denote the two P's as being distinct: $HAP_{1}P_{2}Y$
> 5 distinct letters: $5! = 120 Permutations$
> But since $P_1$ and $P_2$ are the same letter, some of these permutations are double-counted. 
> So the true number of permutations is $5!/2!$ because P is repeated twice.


In general, the number of permutations of a [sets|set](sets|set) of $n$ elements with possible non-distinct elements is: 
$$ \frac{n!}{n_1!n_2! · · · n_r!} $$


Which reduces down to $n!$ if there are no repetitions.
