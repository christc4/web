TARGET DECK

The breadth-first search allows us to find every vertex $v \in V$ that can be reached by the start node $s$ and also the distance from the start, $v.distance = \delta(s,v)$.

Furthermore, since the shortest length path is found by first going from $s$ to $v.previous$ then from $v.previous$ to $v$ we can also find out exactly how we get to $v$ from $s$ by iterating through $v.previous$.
