### The Zero Axiom
Non-triviality - $Ω \neq ∅$ - The sample space cannot be empty.

### Axiom 1: Nonnegativity
$\mathbb{P}(E) \geq 0$ - The likelihood of an event happening cannot be negative.

### Axiom 2: Probability of Omega
$\mathbb{P}(Ω) ≡ 1$ - The probability of the sample space (sum total of all events) is identical to 1.

### Axiom 3: σ-additivity
If events $E_1, E_2, . . .$ are disjoint, then
$$ \mathbb{P}(\bigcup_{i}E_i) = \sum_{i}\mathbb{P}(E_i) $$
Meaning that the probability of the union of all events happening ($E_1$ OR $E_2$ OR $. . .$ ) is the same as the sum of all such probabilities
