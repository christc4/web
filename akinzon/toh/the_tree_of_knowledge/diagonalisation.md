# Diagonalisation

For this proof, we need a [Functions|function](functions|function) with no **fixed point**, i.e. There is no $x$ for which $f(x) = x$. 

Then, we index each element in our supposedly uncountably infinite [sets|set](sets|set) using natural numbers.

Then, for each value on the diagonal, apply the no fixed point function to it to change the value from what it was before, and combine these diagonal values to create a new value that cannot be indexed by the naturals.
