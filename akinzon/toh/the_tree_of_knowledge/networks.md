### What the heck is it??

Networks are multiple computers connected to share information/resources.

As a matter of fact, the Internet is a network of networks!

BTW, Internet != World Wide Web, which are just a range of services available via the Internet.

### Networks operate over a range of sizes

**WAN** - Wide Area Network - Covers a large geographical area

**LAN** - Local Area Network - Covers a small geographical area

**PAN** - Personal Area Network - Covers the small area around a person

**MAN** - Metropolitan Area Network - Covers a metropolitan area (like a city)

### Why do we care?

Well, networks are EVERYWHERE (Websites, Cloud computing, IoT)

Networking issues can be a factor in why correct code could misbehave or be slow - messes up code

### It's deep... It's got layers, man

Layered models for networks give an *abstraction*, they allow for different applications and hosts to talk to each other regardless of the hardware being used.

They also provide an *encapsulation* - Each layer adds a header to the payload, becoming the payload for the next layer. And at the end, you get a fully-assembled frame.
