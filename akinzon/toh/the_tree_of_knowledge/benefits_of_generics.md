Generics make code more readable as we don't have to explicitly cast each time. 

It also reduces the risk of errors since we can be sure that all elements in a generic collection are of the same [Classes|class](classes|class), and can use the same [methods](methods).

The compiler can type check (and thus restrict) objects added to the collection.

It removes the need for many similar classes dealing with collections of different types.

What are the [benefits of Generics](benefits_of_generics)? #flashcard 
Generics reduce/eliminate the need for casting
The compiler is also able to type check and restrict the wrong kind of object from being added to the collection
It also reduces the need for many similar classes dealing with collections of different types.
