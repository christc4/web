Sets are simply a collection of objects.

Objects in a set are referred to as members or elements.

Finite sets (sets with a fixed number of items) can be defined by listing all their elements, e.g. Set A = $\{2, 3, 4\}$

Sets are defined by the elements in them, if two sets have the same elements, they are the same set.

Sets can be infinite, and **ellipsis** (â€¦) is used to denote continuity. The **step** (how much each element increments) must be defined first. E.g. $Set A = \{1,2,...,9\}$ is the set from 1-9, with a step of 1. But $Set B = \{0,2,4,...\}$ would be the set containing even numbers (step of 2, starting from 0).
