Big $\Omega$ notation gives an lower bound for the [running time of an algorithm](running_time_of_an_algorithm), if an algorithm had a big Omega of $\Omega(n^2)$, it would execute **no less than** $n^2$ times.

a function $f(n)$ is a member of $\Omega(g(n))$ if there exist constants $c \gt 0$ and $N \in \mathbb{N}$, such that:
$$ f(n) \ge cg(n)\ for\ n \ge N $$
where $cg(n)$ acts as the lower bound.
