# Out of Order Issue Out of order completion

Up: [Pipelining, Parallelisation and superscalar architecture](pipelining,_parallelisation_and_superscalar_architecture)

Out-of-order issue/Out-of-order completion - decouples the execution and decoding pipelines so that they can be done in parallel where possible  
Since the instructions have been decoded, the processor can "look ahead" 
(Possible prefetch benefit)
