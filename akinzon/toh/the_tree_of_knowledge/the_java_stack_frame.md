Stack Frames in java are the elements of the stacks for each thread.

When a [Methods|method](methods|method) is called, a stack frame is pushed to the stack, and similarly, when that method completes or throws an [Exceptions|exception](exceptions|exception) its corresponding stack frame is popped off the stack.

They are pushed when a [Methods|method](methods|method) is called, and popped when that method completes or an [Exceptions|exception](exceptions|exception) occurs.
