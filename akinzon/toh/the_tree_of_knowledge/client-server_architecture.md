TARGET DECK

In similar spirit to [repository architecture](repository_architecture), client/server architecture has clients that communicate with a central server, which is similar to a repository but has a program/process that manages it.

Servers perform tasks for the clients.

Clients are what end-users interact with.

Both clients and servers are active here since they both have things to do.

**Intuition**: Imagine a judge that answers questions to intermediaries who then interact with the original askers of those questions.
