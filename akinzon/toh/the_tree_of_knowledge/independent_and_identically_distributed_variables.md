# Independent and Identically Distributed Variables

if $X$ and $Y$ are i.i.d random variables, this means that they are [Independent Random Variables](independent_random_variables) and identically distributed.

As such, the two following are true:
$$  \mathbb{P}(X = x , Y = y) = \mathbb{P}(X = x)\mathbb{P}(Y = y)  $$
(independence)

and:
$$ \mathbb{P}(X = x) = \mathbb{P}(Y = x) $$
The probability that variable $X$ takes value $x$ is the same as if variable $Y$ also took value $x$.

For example, if $X$ was tossing a fair die once, and $Y$ was tossing it again, they are obviously independent as they have no effect on each other, and they are identically distributed since they have the same chance for getting any outcome (since its the same die.)
