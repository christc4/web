The Normal Distribution is symmetrical around $\mu$ 

Its mean =  median = mode = $\mu$
68.27% of probability falls within $(µ − σ, µ + σ)$
95.45% of probability falls within $(µ − 2σ, µ + 2σ)$
99.73% of probability falls within $(µ − 3σ, µ + 3σ)$
99.99994% of probability falls within $(µ − 5σ, µ + 5σ)$
